<h2 class="nobreak">CRAMMON, THE STAINLESS KNIGHT</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the days of his earliest manhood, Crammon, a pilgrim
upon the paths of pleasantness and delight, had been a constant
wayfarer from capital to capital and from country-seat
to country-seat. He came of an Austrian family whose landed
estates lay in Moravia, and his full name was Bernard
Gervasius Crammon von Weissenfels.</p>

<p>In Vienna he owned a small but beautifully furnished house.
Two old, unmarried ladies were its guardians&mdash;the Misses
Aglaia and Constantine. They were his distant kinswomen,
but he was devoted to them as to sisters of his blood, and they
returned his affection with an equal tenderness.</p>

<p>On an afternoon in May the two sat by an open window and
gazed longingly down into the street. He had announced the
date of his arrival by letter, but four days had passed and they
were still waiting in vain. Whenever a carriage turned the
corner, both ladies started and looked in the same direction.</p>

<p>When twilight came they closed the window and sighed.
Constantine took Aglaia’s arm, and together they went through
the charming rooms, made gleamingly ready for their master.
All the beautiful things in the house reminded them of him,
just as every one of them was endeared to him because it united
him to some experience or memory.</p>

<p>Here was the chiselled fifteenth century goblet which the
Marquis d’Autichamps had given him, yonder the agate bowl
bequeathed him by the Countess Ortenburg. There were the
coloured etchings, part of the legacy of a Duchess of Gains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>borough,
the precious desk-set which he had received from the
old Baron Regamey, the Tanagra figurines which Felix Imhof
had brought him from Greece. There, above all, was his own
portrait, which the English artist Lavery had painted on an
order from Sir Charles MacNamara.</p>

<p>They knew these things and esteemed them at their true
worth. They stopped before his picture, as they so often delighted
to do. The well rounded face wore a stern, an almost
sombre expression. But that expression seemed deceptive, for
a tell-tale gleam of worldly delight, of irony and roguishness,
played about the clean-shaven lips.</p>

<p>When night fell the two ladies received a telegram informing
them that Crammon had been forced to put off his return
home for a month. They lit no lights after that, and went
sadly to bed.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Once it had happened that Crammon was dining with a few
friends at Baden-Baden. He had just returned from Scotland
where he had visited the famous trout streams of MacPherson,
and had left the train at the end of a long journey. He felt
very tired, and after the meal lay down on a sofa and fell
asleep.</p>

<p>His friends chatted for a while, until his deep breathing
drew their attention to him, and they decided to perpetrate
a jest at his expense. One of them shook him by the shoulder,
and when he opened his eyes asked: “Listen, Bernard, can’t
you tell us what is the matter with Lord Darlington? Where
is he? Why is he never heard of any more?”</p>

<p>Crammon without a moment’s hesitation answered in a
clear voice and with an almost solemn seriousness: “Darlington
is on his yacht in the Bay of Liguria between Leghorn and
Nice. What time is it? Three o’clock? Then he is just about
to take the sedative which his Italian physician, Magliano,
prepares and gives him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned on his other side and slept on.</p>

<p>One of the men, who knew Crammon only slightly, said:
“That’s a pure invention!” The others assured the doubter
that Crammon’s word was above suspicion, and they spoke
softly so as not to disturb his sleep.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>On another occasion Crammon was a guest on an estate in
Hungary, and planned with a group of young men, who were
visiting a neighbouring country-house, to attend a festivity in
the next town. The dawn was breaking when the friends
separated. Crammon, with senses slightly dulled, went on
alone and longed for the bed from which half an hour’s walk
still separated him. By chance he came upon a cattle market
crowded with peasants, who had brought in their cows and
calves from the villages around.</p>

<p>The crowd brought him to a halt, and he stopped to listen
while a bull was being offered for sale. The auctioneer cried:
“I am offered fifty crowns!” There was no answer; the
peasants were slowly turning the matter over in their
minds.</p>

<p>Fifty crowns for a bull? To Crammon’s mind, from which
the wine fumes had not quite faded, it seemed remarkable,
and without hesitation he offered five crowns more. The
peasants drew aside respectfully. One of them offered fifty-six;
Crammon bid fifty-eight. The auctioneer raised his three-fold
cry; the hammer fell. Crammon owned the bull.</p>

<p>A magnificent beast, he said to himself, and felt quite satisfied
with his bargain. But when the time came for him to pay,
he discovered that the bidding had been so much per hundred
weight, and since the bull weighed twelve hundred and fifty
pounds, he was required to pay seven hundred and twenty-five
crowns.</p>

<p>He refused angrily. A loud squabble followed; but his arguments
were useless. The bull was his property. But he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
no such sum of money on his person, and had to hire a man
to accompany him with the animal to his friend’s house.</p>

<p>He strode on wretchedly vexed. The man followed, dragging
the unwilling bull by a rope.</p>

<p>His host helped Crammon out of his embarrassment by
purchasing the bull, but the incident furnished endless amusement
to the whole countryside.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Crammon loved the theatre and everything connected with
it. When the great Marian Wolter died, he locked himself in
his house for a week, and mourned as if for a personal
bereavement.</p>

<p>During a stay in Berlin he heard of the early fame of Edgar
Lorm. He saw him as Hamlet, and when he left the theatre
he embraced an utter stranger and cried out: “I am happy!”
A little crowd gathered.</p>

<p>He had meant to stay in Berlin three days but remained
three months. His connections made it easy for him to meet
Lorm. He overwhelmed the actor with gifts&mdash;costly bric-à-brac,
rare books, exquisite delicacies.</p>

<p>Every morning, when Edgar Lorm arose, Crammon was
there, and with a deep absorption watched the actor at his
morning tasks and his gymnastic exercises. He admired his
slender stature, his noble gestures, his eloquent mimicry, and
the perfection of his voice.</p>

<p>He took care of Lorm’s correspondence for him, interviewed
agents, got rid of unwelcome admirers of either sex. He
called the dramatic reviewers to account, and in the theatre
looked his rage whenever he thought the applause too tepid.
“The beasts should roar,” he said. During the scene in
Richard II in which the king addresses the lords from the
castle wall, his enthusiasm was so great that his friend, the
Princess Uchnina, who shared his box, covered her face with
her fan to escape the glances of the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>To him Lorm was in very truth the royal Richard, the
melancholy Hamlet, Romeo the lover, and Fiesko the rebel.
His faith in the actor’s art was boundless; his imagination was
wholly convinced. He attributed to him the wit of Beaumarchais,
the eloquence of Antony, the sarcasm of Mephistopheles,
the dæmonic energy of Franz Moor. When it was
necessary for him to part, he did not conceal his grief, and
from afar wrote him at intervals a letter of adoration.</p>

<p>The actor accepted this worship as a tribute that differed
fundamentally from the average praise and love with which
he was beginning to be satiated.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Lola Hesekiel, the celebrated beauty, owed her good fortune
wholly to Crammon. Crammon had educated her and
given her her place in the world and its appreciation.</p>

<p>When she was but an undistinguished young girl Crammon
took a trip with her to Sylt. There they met Crammon’s friend,
Franz Lothar von Westernach. Lola fell in love with the
handsome young aristocrat, and one evening, after a tender
hour, she confessed her love for the other to Crammon.
Then Crammon arose from his couch, dressed himself, went to
Franz Lothar’s room and brought the shy lad in. “My
children,” he said in the kindliest way, “I give you to each
other. Be happy and enjoy your youth.” With these words
he left the two alone. And for long neither of them quite
knew how to take so unwonted a situation.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>A curious occurrence was that connected with the Countess
Ortenburg and the agate bowl.</p>

<p>The countess was an old lady of seventy, who lived in
retirement at her château near Bregenz. Crammon, who had
a great liking for ancient ladies of dignity and worldly wisdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
visited her almost annually to cheer her and to chat with her
about the past.</p>

<p>The countess was grateful to him for his devotion, and
determined to reward it. One day she showed him an agate
bowl mounted on gold, an heirloom of her house, and told him
that this bowl would be his after her death, as she had provided
in her will.</p>

<p>Crammon flushed with pleasure, and tenderly kissed her
hand. At every visit he took occasion to see the precious
bowl, revelled in the sight of it, and enjoyed the foretaste of
complete possession.</p>

<p>The countess died, and Crammon was soon notified concerning
her legacy. The bowl was sent him carefully packed
in a box. When it was freed of its wrappings he saw with
amazement and disgust that he had been cheated. What he
held was an imitation&mdash;skilfully and exactly made. But the
material was base; only the setting had been copied in real
gold.</p>

<p>Bitterly he considered what to do. Whom dared he accuse?
How could he prove the very existence of the genuine bowl?</p>

<p>The heirs of the countess were three nephews of her name.
The eldest, Count Leopold, was in ill repute as a miser who
grudged himself and others their very bread. If he had
played the trick, the bowl had been sold long ago.</p>

<p>It was easy to find a pretext for visiting Count Leopold at
Salzburg. He sought distinction in piety and stood in favour
at the bishop’s court. Crammon thought that there was a
gleam of embarrassment in the man’s eyes. He himself peered
about like a lynx. In vain.</p>

<p>He happened, however, to know all the prominent dealers
in antiquities on the Continent, and so he set out on a quest.
For two months and a half he travelled from city to city, from
one dealer to another, and asked questions, investigated, and
kept a sharp look-out. He carried the imitation bowl with him
and showed it to all. The dealers were quite familiar with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sight of a connoisseur with his heart set on some object of art;
they answered his questions willingly and sent him hither and
thither.</p>

<p>He was on the point of despairing, when in Aix he was told
of a dealer in Brussels who was said to have acquired the
bowl. It was true. He found the object of his search in
Brussels. Crammon inquired after the name of the seller and
discovered it to be that of one who had business relations
with Count Leopold. The Belgian dealer demanded twenty
thousand francs for the bowl. Crammon at once deposited
one thousand, with the assurance that he would pay the rest
within a week and then take the bowl. He made no attempt
at bargaining, much to the astonishment of the dealer. But
in his rage he thought: I have snared the thief. Why should
his rascality come cheaply?</p>

<p>Two days later he entered the count’s room. He was
accompanied by a hotel porter, who placed a box containing
the imitation bowl on a table and disappeared. The count
was breakfasting alone. He arose and frowned.</p>

<p>Crammon silently opened the little box, lifted the bowl out,
polished it carefully with a handkerchief, kept it in his hand,
and assumed a care-worn look.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked the count, turning pale.</p>

<p>Crammon told him how, by the merest chance, he had
discovered in a Brussels shop this bowl which, as he knew,
had been for centuries in the possession of the Ortenburgs. It
had, therefore, scarcely required the mournful memory of his
dear and honoured old friend to persuade him to restore the
precious object to the family treasury whence it came. He
esteemed it a great good fortune that it was he who had discovered
this impious trade in precious things. Had it been any
one else the danger of loose tongues causing an actual scandal
was obvious enough. He had, he continued, paid twenty
thousand francs for the bowl, which he had brought in order to
restore it to the house of Ortenburg. The receipt was at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
count’s disposal. All he requested of the count was a cheque
for the amount involved.</p>

<p>He breathed no word concerning a will or a legacy, and
betrayed no suspicion of how he had been tricked. The count
understood. He looked at the imitation bowl on the table and
recognized it for what it was. But he lacked courage to object.
He swallowed his rage, sat down and made out the cheque.
His chin quivered with fury. Crammon was radiant. He left
the imitation bowl where it stood, and at once set out for
Brussels to fetch the other.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>There were three things that Crammon hated from the
bottom of his heart: newspapers, universal education, and
taxes. It was especially impossible for him to realize that he,
like others, was subject to taxation.</p>

<p>He had been summoned on a certain occasion to give an
accounting of his income. He declared that during the greater
part of the year he lived as a guest in the châteaux and on
the estates of his friends.</p>

<p>The examining official replied that since he was known to
live a rather luxurious life, it was clear that he must have a
fixed income from some source.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” Crammon lied with the utmost cynicism.
“This income consists wholly of meagre winnings at the various
international gambling resorts. Earnings of that sort are
not subject to taxation.”</p>

<p>The official was astonished and shook his head. He left the
room in order to consult his superiors in regard to the case.
Crammon was left alone. Trembling with rage he gazed about
him, took a stack of legal documents from a shelf, and shoved
them far behind a bookcase against the wall. There, so far as
one could tell, they would moulder in the course of the years,
and in their illegal hiding place save the owners of the names
they recorded from taxation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>For years he would chuckle whenever he thought of this
deviltry.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The Princess Uchnina had made Crammon’s acquaintance in
one of the castles of the Esterhazys in Hungary. Even at that
time the free manner of her life had set tongues wagging;
later on her family disowned her.</p>

<p>He met her again in a hotel at Cairo. Since she was wealthy
there was no danger of his being exploited. He had little liking
for the professional vampire, nor had he ever lost the
mastery over his senses. There was no passion that could
prevent him from going to bed at ten and sleeping soundly
through a long night. The princess was fond of laughing and
Crammon helped her to laugh, since it pleased him to see her
amused. He did not care to be loved beyond measure; he
valued considerate treatment and a comradely freedom of
contact. He had no desire for love with its usual spices of
romance and disquietude, jealousy and enslavement. He
wanted the delight of love in as tangible and sensible a form
as possible; he cared less for the flame than for the dainty on
the spit.</p>

<p>On the ship that took him and the princess to Brindisi
there appeared a Danish lady with hair the hue of wheat and
eyes like cornflowers. She was lonely, and he sought her out
and succeeded in charming her. The three travelled together to
Naples, where the Danish lady and Crammon seemed to have
become friendlier than ever; but the princess only laughed.</p>

<p>They arrived in Florence. In front of the Baptistery Crammon
met a melancholy young woman, whom he recognized as
an acquaintance made at Ostende. She was the daughter of
a manufacturer of Mainz. She had married recently, but her
husband had lost her dowry at Monte Carlo and had fled to
America. Crammon introduced her to the other ladies, but,
for the sake of the Dane, who was suspicious and exacting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
passed her off as his cousin. It was not long, however, before
a quarrel broke out between the two, and Crammon was very
busy preaching the spirit of reconciliation and peace.</p>

<p>The princess laughed.</p>

<p>Crammon said: “I should like to see how many women one
can gather together like this without their thirsting for one
another’s blood.” He made a wager with the princess for a
hundred marks that he could increase the number to five,
herself of course excepted.</p>

<p>In the station at Milan a charming creature ran into him,
and gave signs of unalloyed delight. She was an actress who
had been intimate with a friend of his years before. She had
just been engaged by a theatre in Petrograd and was now on
her way there. Crammon found her so amusing that he
neglected the others for her sake; and although he was not
lacking in subtlety, the signs of a coming revolution in his
palace increased. The revolution broke out in Munich. There
were hard words and tears; trunks were packed; and the ladies
scattered to all the points of the compass,&mdash;North to Denmark,
West to Mainz, East to Petrograd.</p>

<p>Crammon was mournful; he had lost his bet. The little
princess laughed. She remained with him until another lure
grew stronger. Then they celebrated a cheerful farewell.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>When Crammon was but a youth of twenty-three he had once
been a member of a large hunting party at Count Sinsheim’s.
Among the guests there was a gentleman named von Febronius
who attracted his attention, first by his silence, and next by
frequently seeking his society while carefully avoiding the
others.</p>

<p>One day Febronius, with unusual urgency, begged Crammon
to visit him.</p>

<p>Febronius possessed an extensive entailed estate on the
boundary between Silesia and Poland. He was the last of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
race and name, and, as every one knew, deeply unhappy on this
account. Nine years earlier he had married the daughter of
a middle-class family of Breslau, and in spite of the difference
in age the two were genuinely devoted to each other. The
wife was thirty, the husband near fifty. The marriage had
proved childless, and there seemed now no further hope.</p>

<p>Crammon promised to come, and some weeks later, on an
evening in May, he arrived at the estate. Febronius was delighted
to see him, but the lady, who was pretty and cultivated,
was noticeably chill in her demeanour. Whenever she was
forced to look at Crammon a perceptible change of colour
overspread her face.</p>

<p>Next morning Febronius showed him the whole estate&mdash;the
park, the fields and forests, the stables and dairies. It
was a little kingdom, and Crammon expressed his admiration;
but his host sighed. He said that his blessings had all been
embittered, every beast of the field seemed to regard him with
reproachful eyes, and the land and its fertility meant nothing
to him who had brought death to his race, and whom the
fertility of nature but put in mind of the sterile curse which
had come upon his blood.</p>

<p>Then he became silent, and silently accompanied Crammon,
whose head whirled with very bold and equivocal thoughts.</p>

<p>After dinner they were sitting on the terrace with Frau
von Febronius. Suddenly the lord of the manor was called
away and returned shortly with a telegram in his hand. He
said that an urgent matter of business required him to set out
on a journey at once. Crammon arose with a gesture, to show
his consciousness of the propriety of his leaving too. But his
host, almost frightened, begged him to stay and keep his wife
company. It was, he said, only a matter of two days, and she
would be grateful.</p>

<p>He stammered these words and grew pale. His wife kept
her face bent closely over her embroidery frame, and Crammon
saw her fingers tremble. He knew enough. He shook hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with Febronius, and knew that they would not and dared not
meet again in life.</p>

<p>He found the lady, when they were alone together, shier
than he had anticipated. Her gestures expressed reluctance,
her glances fear. When his speech grew bolder, shame and
indignation flamed in her eyes. She fled from him, sought him
again, and when in the evening they strolled through the park
she implored him to leave next day, and went to the stables to
order the carriage for the morning. When he consented, her
behaviour altered, her torment and her harshness seemed to
melt. After midnight she suddenly appeared in his room, struggling
with herself and on the defensive, defiant and deeply
humiliated, bitter in her yielding, and in her very tenderness
estranged.</p>

<p>Early next morning the carriage was ready and drove him to
the station.</p>

<p>That marvellous night faded from his memory as a thousand
others, less marvellous, had done. The spectral experience
blended with a host of others that were without its aroma of
spiritual pain.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Sixteen years later chance brought him into the same part of
the country.</p>

<p>He inquired after Febronius, and learned that that gentleman
had been dead for ten years. He was told, furthermore,
that during his last years the character of Febronius had
changed radically. He had become a spendthrift; frightful
mismanagement had ruined his estate and shaken his fortune;
swindlers and false friends had ruled him exclusively, so that
his widow, who was still living on the estate with her only
daughter, could scarcely maintain herself there. She was beset
by usurious creditors and a growing burden of debt; she did
not know an easy hour, and complete ruin was but a matter of
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Crammon drove over to the estate, and had himself announced
under an assumed name. When Frau von Febronius
entered he saw that she was still charming. Her hair was still
brown, her features curiously young. But there was something
frightened and suspicious about her.</p>

<p>She asked where she had had the pleasure of his acquaintance.
Crammon simply regarded her for a while, and she too
looked at him attentively. Suddenly she uttered a cry and
hid her face in her hands. When she had mastered her emotion,
she gave him her hand. Then she left the room, and
returned in a few minutes leading a young girl of great sweetness.</p>

<p>“Here she is.”</p>

<p>The girl smiled. Her lips curved as though she were about
to pout, and her teeth showed the glittering moisture of shells
to which the water of the sea still clings.</p>

<p>She spoke of the beautiful day and of her having lain in the
sun. The broken alto voice surprised one in so young a
creature. In her wide, brown eyes there was a radiance of
unbounded desires. Crammon was flattered, and thought:
If God had made me a woman, perhaps I should have been such
an one. He asked after her name. It was Letitia.</p>

<p>Frau von Febronius clung to the girl with every glance.</p>

<p>Letitia brought in a basket full of golden pears. She looked
at the fruit with greed and with an ironic consciousness of her
greed. She cut a pear in half and found a worm in it. That
disgusted her and she complained bitterly.</p>

<p>Crammon asked her what she cared for most, and she
answered: “Jewels.”</p>

<p>Her mother reproached her with being careless of what she
had. “Only the other day,” said Frau von Febronius, “she
lost a costly ring.”</p>

<p>“Just give me something to love,” Letitia replied and stroked
a white kitten that purred and jumped on her lap, “and I’ll
hold on to it fast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>When he said farewell Crammon promised to write, and
Letitia promised to send him her picture.</p>

<p>A few weeks later Frau von Febronius informed him that she
had taken Letitia to Weimar, and placed her in the care of
her sister, the Countess Brainitz.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>On Crammon’s fortieth birthday he received from seven of
his friends, whose names were signed to it, a document written
in the elaborate script and manner of an official diploma.
And the content of the document was this:</p>

<p>“O Crammon, friend of friends, admirer of women and contemner
of their sex, enemy of marriage, glass of fashion, defender
of descent, shield of high rank, guest of all noble spirits,
finder of the genuine, tester of the exquisite, friend of the
people and hater of mankind, long sleeper and rebel, Bernard
Gervasius, hail to thee!”</p>

<p>Gleaming with pride and satisfaction Crammon hung up the
beautifully framed parchment on the wall beside his bed.
Then with the two ladies of his household he took a turn in
the park.</p>

<p>Miss Aglaia walked at his right, Miss Constantine at his
left. Both were festively arrayed, though in a somewhat
antique fashion, and their faces were the happiest to be seen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHRISTIAN’S REST</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crammon</span> found the forties to be a critical period in a
man’s life. It is then that in his mind he sits in judgment upon
himself; he seeks the sum of his existence, and finds blunder
after blunder in the reckoning.</p>

<p>But these moral difficulties did not very much influence
either his attitude or the character of his activities. He found
his appetite for life growing, but he found loneliness a heavier
burden than before. When he was alone he was overcome by
a feeling which he called the melancholy of the half-way
house.</p>

<p>In Paris he was overtaken by this distemper of the soul.
Felix Imhof and Franz Lothar von Westernach had agreed to
meet him, and both had left him in the lurch. Imhof had
been kept in Frankfort by his business on the exchange and
his real estate interests, and had telegraphed a later date of
arrival. Franz Lothar had remained in Switzerland with his
brother and Count Prosper Madruzzi.</p>

<p>In his vexation Crammon spent his days largely in bed.
He either read foolish novels or murmured his annoyances
over to himself. Out of sheer boredom he ordered fourteen
pairs of boots of those three or four masters of the craft who
work only for the elect and accept a new customer only when
recommended by a distinguished client.</p>

<p>He was to have spent the month of September with the
Wahnschaffe family on their estate in the Odenwald. He had
made the acquaintance of young Wolfgang Wahnschaffe the
summer before at a tennis tournament in Hamburg, and had
accepted his invitation. In his exasperation over his truant
friends he now wrote and excused himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>One evening in Montmartre he met the painter Weikhardt,
whom he had known in Munich. They walked together for
a while, and Weikhardt encouraged Crammon to visit a
neighbouring music hall. A very young dancer had been
appearing there for the past week, the painter told him, and
many French colleagues had advised seeing her.</p>

<p>Crammon agreed.</p>

<p>Weikhardt led him through a maze of suspicious looking
alleys to a no less suspicious looking house. This was the
Théâtre Sapajou. A boy in fantastic costume opened the door
that led to a moderately large, half-darkened hall with scarlet
walls and a wooden gallery. About fifty people, mostly
painters and writers with their wives, sat facing a tiny stage.
The performance had begun.</p>

<p>Two fiddles and a clarionet furnished the music.</p>

<p>And Crammon saw Eva Sorel dance.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>His anger against his friends was extinguished. He was glad
that they were not here.</p>

<p>He was afraid of meeting any of his many Parisian acquaintances
and passed through the streets with lowered eyes. The
thought was repulsive to him that he would be forced to speak
to them of Eva Sorel, and then to see their indifferent or curious
faces, beneath which there could be no feeling akin to his
own.</p>

<p>He avoided the painter Weikhardt, for the latter would rob
him of the illusion that he, Crammon, had discovered Eva
Sorel, and that for the present she lived only in his consciousness
as the miracle that he felt her to be.</p>

<p>He went about like an unrecognized rich man, or else as
troubled as a miser who knows that thieves lie in wait for
his treasure. All who carried their chatter of delight from the
Théâtre Sapajou out into the world he regarded as thieves.
They threatened to attract to the little playhouse the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of the stupid and the banal who drag great things into the dust
by making them fashionable.</p>

<p>He nursed the dream of kidnapping the dancer and of
fleeing with her to a deserted island of the sea. He would
have been satisfied to adore her there and would have asked
nothing of her.</p>

<p>For Lorm he had demanded applause. But he hated the
favour which the dancer gained. Not because she was a
woman. It was not the jealousy of the male. He did not
think of her under the aspect of sex. Her being was to him the
fulfilment of dark presentiments and visions; she represented
the spirit of lightness as opposed to the heaviness of life which
weighed him and others down; she was flight that mocked
the creeping of the earth-bound, the mystery that is beyond
knowledge, form that is the denial of chaos.</p>

<p>He said: “This boasted twentieth century, young as it is,
wearies my nerves. Humanity drags itself across the earth
like an ugly clumsy worm. She desires freedom from this
condition, and in her yearning to escape the chrysalis she finds
the dance. It is a barbaric spirit of comedy at its highest
point.”</p>

<p>He knew well that the life he led was a challenge and a
disturbance to his fellow men who earned their bread by the
sweat of their toil. He was an enthusiastic admirer of those
ages in which the ruling classes had really ruled, when a prince
of the Church had had a capon stuffer amid the officials of his
court, and an insignificant count of the Holy Roman Empire
had paid an army that consisted of one general, six colonels,
four drummers, and two privates. And he was grateful to the
dancer because she lifted him out of his own age even more
thoroughly than the actor had done.</p>

<p>He made an idol of her, for the years were coming in which
he needed one&mdash;he who, satiated, still knew hunger with senses
avid for the flight of birds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Eva Sorel had a companion and guardian, Susan Rappard,
a thorough scarecrow, clad in black, and absent-minded. She
had emerged with Eva out of the unknown past, and she was
still rubbing its darkness out of her eyes when Eva, at eighteen,
saw the paths of light open to her. But she played the piano
admirably, and thus accompanied Eva’s practice.</p>

<p>Crammon had paid her some attentions, and the tone in
which he spoke of her mistress gained her sympathy. She
persuaded Eva to receive him. “Take her flowers,” she whispered.
“She’s fond of them.”</p>

<p>Eva and Susan Rappard lived in two rooms in a small hotel.
Crammon brought such masses of roses that the close corridors
held the fragrance for many hours.</p>

<p>As he entered he saw Eva in an armchair in front of a
mirror. Susan was combing her hair, which was of the colour
of honey.</p>

<p>On the carpet was kneeling a lad of seventeen who was very
pale and whose face bore traces of tears. He had declared
his love to Eva. Even when the stranger entered he had no
impulse to get up; his luckless passion made him blind.</p>

<p>Crammon remained standing by the door.</p>

<p>“Susan, you’re hurting me!” Eva cried. Susan was startled
and dropped the comb.</p>

<p>Eva held out her hand to Crammon. He approached and
bent over to kiss it.</p>

<p>“Poor chap,” she said, smiling, and indicating the lad, “he
torments himself cruelly. It’s so foolish.”</p>

<p>The boy pressed his forehead against the back of her chair.
“I’ll kill myself,” he whimpered. Eva clapped her hands and
brought her face with its arch mockery of sadness near to the
boy’s.</p>

<p>“What a gesture!” Crammon thought. “How perfect in its
light completeness, how delicate, how new! And how she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
raised her lids and showed the strong light of her starry eyes,
and dropped her chin a little in that inclination of the head,
and wore a smile that was unexpected in its blending of desire
and sweetness and cunning and childlikeness!”</p>

<p>“Where is my golden snood?” Eva asked and arose.</p>

<p>Susan said that she had left it on the table. She looked
there in vain. She fluttered hither and thither like a huge
black butterfly: she opened and closed drawers, shook her
head, thoughtfully pressed her hand against her forehead, and
finally found the snood under the piano lid next to a roll of
bank notes.</p>

<p>“It’s always that way with us,” Eva sighed. “We always
find things. But we have to hunt a long time.” She fastened
the snood about her hair.</p>

<p>“I can’t place your French accent,” Crammon remarked.
His own pronunciation was Parisian.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she answered. “Perhaps it’s Spanish. I
was in Spain a long time. Perhaps it’s German. I was born
in Germany and lived there till I was twelve.” Her eyes grew
a little sombre.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The lovelorn boy had left. Eva seemed to have forgotten
him, and there was no shadow upon the brunette pallor of
her face. She sat down again, and after a brief exchange of
questions she told him of an experience that she had had.</p>

<p>The reason for her telling the story seemed to inhere in
thoughts which she did not express. Her glance rested calmly
in the illimitable. Her eyes knew no walls in their vision;
no one could assert that she looked at him. She merely
gazed.</p>

<p>Susan Rappard sat by the tile-oven, resting her chin upon
her arm, while her fingers, gliding past the furrowed cheeks,
clung amid her greyish hair.</p>

<p>At Arles in Provence a young monk named Brother Leotade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
had often visited Eva. He was not over twenty-five, vigorous,
a typical Frenchman of the South, though rather taciturn.</p>

<p>He loved the land and knew the old castles. Once he spoke
to her of a tower that stood on a cliff, a mile from the city;
he described the view from the top of the tower in words that
made Eva long to enjoy it. He offered to be her guide, and
they agreed on the hour and the day.</p>

<p>The tower had an iron gate which was kept locked, and the
key was in the keeping of a certain vintner. It was late afternoon
when they set out, but on the unshaded road it was still
hot. They meant to be back before night fall, and so they
walked quickly; but when they reached the tower the sun had
already disappeared behind the hills.</p>

<p>Brother Leotade opened the iron gate and they saw a
narrow spiral staircase of stone. They climbed a few stairs.
Then the monk turned suddenly, locked the door from within,
and slipped the key into the pocket of his cowl. Eva asked his
reason. He replied that it was safer so.</p>

<p>It was dim in the vaulted tower, and Eva saw a menacing
gleam in the monk’s eyes. She let him precede her, but on a
landing he turned and grasped her. She was silent, although
she felt the pressure of his fingers. Still silent, she glided from
his grasp, and ran up as swiftly as she could. She heard no
steps behind her in the darkness, and the stairs seemed endless.
Still she climbed until her breath gave out, and she
panted for the light. Suddenly the greenish bell of the sky
gleamed into the shaft; and as she mounted, the circle of her
vision widened to the scarlet of the West, and when she stood
on the last step and on the platform, having emerged from
the mustiness of the old walls into the balsamic coolness and
the multiform and tinted beauty of earth and air, the danger
seemed wholly past.</p>

<p>She waited and watched the dark hole from which she had
come. The monk did not appear. His treacherous concealment
strained her nerves to the uttermost. The brief twilight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
faded; evening turned into night; there was no sound, no
tread. Not until late did it occur to her that she could call
for help. She cried out into the land, but she saw that it
was a desolate region in which no one dwelled. And when
her feeble cry had died away, the shape of Brother Leotade
appeared at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>The expression on his face filled her now with an even
greater horror. He murmured something and stretched out
his arms after her. She bounded backward, groping behind
her with her hands. He followed her, and she leaped upon
the parapet, crouched near the pinnacle, hard by the outer
rim of the wall, her head and shoulders over the abyss. The
wind caught the veil that had been wound about her head and
it streamed forth like a flag. The monk stood still, bound
to the spot by her eyes. His own were fixed relentlessly upon
her, but he dared not move, for he saw the determination
in her face: if he moved toward her, she would leap to her
death.</p>

<p>And yet a rage of desire kept flaring in his eyes.</p>

<p>The hours passed. The monk stood there as though cast
of bronze, while she crouched on the parapet, motionless but
for her fluttering veil, and held him with her eye as one holds
a wolf. Stars gathered in the sky; from time to time she
glanced for a second at the firmament. Never had she been
so near to the eternal flame. She seemed to hear the melody
of a million worlds singing in their orbits; her unmoving limbs
seemed to vibrate; the hands with which she clung to the harsh
wall seemed to upbear the adamantine roof of the cosmos,
while below her was the created thing, blind and wracked by
passion and sworn to a God whom it belied.</p>

<p>Gradually the rim of heaven grew bright and the birds
began to flutter upward. Then Brother Leotade threw himself
upon his face and began to pray aloud. And as the East grew
brighter he lifted up more resonantly the voice of his prayer.
He crept toward the stairs. Then he arose and disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>She saw him issue from the gate below and disappear in the
dawn among the vineyards. Eva lay long in the grass below,
worn and dull, before she could walk back to the city.</p>

<p>“It may be,” she said at the end of her story, “that some
one looked on from Sirius, some one who will come soon and
perhaps be my friend.” She smiled.</p>

<p>“From Sirius?” The voice of Susan was heard. “Where
will he get pearls and diadems? What crowns will he offer
you, and what provinces? Let us have no dealings with
beggars, even though they come from the sky.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet, you Sancho Panza!” Eva said. “All that
I ask is that he can laugh, laugh marvellously&mdash;laugh like that
young muleteer at Cordova! Do you remember him? I want
him to laugh so that I can forget my ambitions.”</p>

<p>Hers is a virtue that hardly begs for pennies, thought Crammon,
and determined to be on his guard and seek security while
there was time. For in his breast he felt a new, unknown,
and melancholy burning, and he knew well that he could not
laugh like that young Cordovan muleteer and make an ambitious
woman forget her striving.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Felix Imhof arrived, and with him Wolfgang Wahnschaffe,
a very tall young man of twenty-two. There was an elegance
about the latter that suggested unlimited means. His father
was one of the German steel kings.</p>

<p>Crammon’s refusal of his invitation had annoyed Wahnschaffe,
and he was anxious to secure the older man’s friendship.
It was characteristic of the Wahnschaffes to desire most
strongly whatever seemed to withhold itself from their
grasp.</p>

<p>They went to the Théâtre Sapajou, and Felix Imhof agreed
that the dancer was incomparable. Plans at once flew from
his mind like sparks from beaten iron in a smithy. He talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of founding an Academy of the Dance, of hiring an impresario
for a tour through Europe, of inventing a pantomime. All
this was to be done, so to speak, over night.</p>

<p>They sat together and drank a good deal&mdash;first wine, then
champagne, then ale, then whiskey, then coffee, then wine
once more. The excess had no effect on Imhof at all; in his
soberest moments he was like others in the ecstasy of drunkenness.</p>

<p>He celebrated the praises of Gauguin, of Schiller, and of
Balzac, and developed the plan for a great experiment in
human eugenics. Faultless men and women were to be chosen
and united and to beget an Arcadian race.</p>

<p>In the midst of it all he quoted passages of Keats and
Rabelais, mixed drinks of ten kinds, and related a dozen
succulent anecdotes from his wide experience with women.
His mouth with its sensual lips poured forth superlatives, his
protruding negroid eyes sparkled with whim and wit, and his
spare, sinewy body seemed to suffer if it was forced to but a
minute’s immobility.</p>

<p>The other two nearly fell asleep through sheer weariness.
He grew steadily more awake and noisy, waved his hands,
beat on the table, inhaled the smoky air luxuriously, and
laughed with his gigantic bass voice.</p>

<p>Five successive nights were spent in this way. That was
enough for Crammon and he determined to leave. Wolfgang
Wahnschaffe had invited him to a hunting party at Waldleiningen.</p>

<p>It was at eleven in the forenoon when Felix Imhof burst
in on Crammon. In the middle of the room stood a huge
open trunk. Linen, clothes, books, shoes, cravattes were
scattered about like things hastily saved in a fire. Outside of
the window swayed in flaming yellow the tree-tops of the
Park Monceau.</p>

<p>Crammon sat in an armchair. He was naked but for a
pair of long hose. He had breakfasted thus, and his expres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>sion
was sombre. His square Gothic head and his broad,
muscular torso seemed made of bronze.</p>

<p>The day before Felix Imhof had made the acquaintance
of Cardillac, ruler of the Paris Bourse, and was on his way
to him now. He was going to embark on some enterprise of
Cardillac to the extent of two millions, and asked Crammon
in passing whether the latter did not wish to risk something too.
A trifle, say fifty thousand francs, would suffice. Cardillac was
a magician who trebled one’s money in three days. Then you
had had the pleasure of the game and the suspense.</p>

<p>“This Cardillac,” he said, “is a wonder. He began life
as an errand boy in an hotel. Now he is chief shareholder in
thirty-seven corporations, founder of the Franco-Hispanic
Bank, owner of the zinc mines of Le Nère, ruler of a horde
of newspapers, and master of a fortune running into the hundreds
of millions.”</p>

<p>Crammon arose, and from the heaps on the floor drew forth
a violet dressing gown which he put over his shivering body.
He looked in it like a cardinal.</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know,” he asked, thoughtfully and
sleepily, “or did you by chance ever observe how the young
muleteers in Cordova laugh?”</p>

<p>Imhof’s helpless astonishment made him look stupid. He
was silent.</p>

<p>Crammon took a large peach from a plate and began to
eat it. You could see drops of the amber juice.</p>

<p>“There’s no way out,” he said, and sighed sadly, “I shall
have to go to Cordova myself.”</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>On their journey Wahnschaffe told Crammon about his
family: his sister Judith, his older brother Christian, his
mother, who had the most beautiful pearls in Europe. “When
she wears them,” he said, “she looks like an Indian goddess.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
His father he described as an amiable man with unseen
backgrounds of the soul.</p>

<p>Crammon was anxious to get as much light as possible on the
life and history of one of those great and rich bourgeois
families which had won in the race against the old aristocracy.
Here, it seemed to him, was a new world, an undiscovered
country which was still in the blossoming stage and which
was to be feared.</p>

<p>His cleverly put questions got him no farther. What he
did learn was a story of silent, bitter rivalry between this
brother and Christian, who seemed to Wolfgang to be preferred
to himself to an incomprehensible degree. He heard a
story of doubt and complaint and scorn, and of words that
the mother of the two had uttered to a stranger: “You don’t
know my son Christian? He is the most precious thing God
ever made.”</p>

<p>It was cheap enough, Wolfgang asserted, to praise a horse
in the stable, one that had never been sent to the Derby
because it was thought to be too noble and precious. Crammon
was amused by the sporting simile. Why was that cheap, he
asked, and what was its exact meaning?</p>

<p>Wolfgang said that it applied to Christian, who had as yet
proved himself in no way, nor accomplished anything despite
his twenty-three years. He had passed his final examinations
at college with difficulty; he was no luminary in any respect.
No one could deny that he had an admirable figure, an elegant
air, a complexion like milk and blood. He had also, it was
not to be denied, a charm so exquisite that no man or woman
could withstand him. But he was cold as a hound’s nose and
smooth as an eel, and as immeasurably spoiled and arrogant
as though the whole world had been made for his sole
benefit.</p>

<p>“You will succumb to him as every one does,” Wolfgang
said finally, and there was something almost like hatred in his
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>They arrived in Waldleiningen on a rainy evening of October.
The house was full of guests.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Wolfgang’s prediction came true sooner than he himself
would perhaps have thought. As early as the third day
Crammon and Christian Wahnschaffe were inseparable and
utterly united. They conversed with an air of intimacy as
though they had known each other for years. The difference
of almost two decades in their ages seemed simply non-existent.</p>

<p>With a laugh Crammon reminded Wolfgang of his prophecy,
and added, “I hope that nothing worse will ever be predicted
to me, and that delightful things will always become realities
so promptly.” And he knocked wood, for he was as superstitious
as an old wife.</p>

<p>Wolfgang’s expression seemed to say: I was quite prepared
for it. What else is one to expect?</p>

<p>Crammon had expected to find Christian spoiled and effeminate.
Instead he saw a thoroughly healthy blond young
athlete, a head and more taller than himself, conscious of his
vigour and beauty, without a trace of vanity, and radiant in
every mood. It was true, as he had heard, that all were
at his beck and call, from his mother to the youngest of the
grooms, and that he accepted everything as he did fair weather&mdash;simply,
lightly, and graciously, but without binding himself
to any reciprocal obligation.</p>

<p>Crammon loved young men who were as elastic as panthers
and whose serenity transformed the moods of others as a
precious aroma does the air of a sick room. Such youths
seemed to him to be gifted with an especial grace. One should,
he held, clear their path of anything that might hinder their
beneficent mission. He did not strive to impress them but
rather to learn of them.</p>

<p>It was in England and among the English that he had found
this respect for youth and ripening manhood, which had long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
become a principle with him and a rule of life. The climate
of a perfectly nurtured understanding he thought the fittest
atmosphere for such a being, and made his plans in secret.
He thought of the grand tour in the sense of the eighteenth
century, with himself in the rôle of mentor and guide.</p>

<p>In the meantime he and Christian talked about hunting,
trout-fishing, the various ways of preparing venison, the advantages
of each season over the others, the numerous charms of
the female sex, the amusing characteristics of common
acquaintances. And of all these light things he spoke in a
thoughtful manner and with exhausting thoroughness.</p>

<p>He could not see Christian without reflecting: What eyes
and teeth and head and limbs! Nature has here used her
choicest substance, meant for permanence as well as delight,
and a master has fitted the parts into harmony. If one were
a mean-spirited fellow one could burst with envy.</p>

<p>One incident charmed him so much that he felt impelled to
communicate his delight to the others who had also witnessed
it. It took place in the yard where early in the morning
the hunting parties assembled. The dogs were to be
leashed. Christian stood alone among twenty-three mastiffs
who leaped around and at him with deafening barks and yells.
He swung a short-handled whip which whirred above their
heads. The beasts grew wilder; he had to ward off the fiercer
ones with his elbow. The forester wanted to come to his help
and called to the raging pack. Christian beckoned him to
stay back. The man’s assumed anger and all his gestures
irritated the dogs. One of them, whose mouth was flecked
with foam, snapped at Christian, and the sharp teeth clung to
his shoulder. Then all cried out, especially Judith. But
Christian gave a short sharp whistle from between his teeth,
his arms dropped, his glance held the dogs nearest to him, and
suddenly the noise stopped, and only those in front gave a
humble whine.</p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe had grown pale. She approached her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
son and asked him whether he was hurt. He was not, although
his jacket showed a long rent.</p>

<p>“He leads a charmed life,” she said that night after dinner
to Crammon, with whom she had withdrawn to a quiet corner.
“And that is my one consolation. His utter recklessness often
frightens me. I have noticed with pleasure that you take an
interest in him. Do try to guide him a little along reasonable
ways.”</p>

<p>Her voice was hollow and her face immobile. Her eyes stared
past one. She knew no cares and had never known any, nor
had she, apparently, ever reflected concerning those of others.
Yet no one had ever seen this woman smile. The utter absence
of friction in her life seemed to have reduced the motions of her
soul to a point of deadness. Only the thought of Christian gave
her whole being a shade of warmth; only when she could speak
of him did she grow eloquent.</p>

<p>Crammon answered: “My dear lady, it is better to leave a
fellow like Christian to his own fate. That is his best protection.”</p>

<p>She nodded, although she disliked the colloquial carelessness
of his speech. She told him how in his boyhood Christian had
once gone to visit the lumbermen in the forest. The trunk of a
mighty pine had been almost cut through, and the men ran to
the end of the rope attached to the tree’s top. The great tree
wavered when they first noticed the boy. They cried out in
horror, and tried to let the tree crash down in another direction.
It was too late. And while some tugged desperately at the
rope and were beside themselves with fright, a few headed by
the foreman ran with lifted and warning arms into the very
sphere of danger. The boy stood there quietly, and gazed
unsuspectingly upward. The tree fell and crushed the foreman
to death. But the branches slipped gently over Christian
as if to caress him; and when the pine lay upon the earth, he
stood in the midst of its topmost twigs as though he had
been placed there, untouched and unastonished. And those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
were there said he had been saved literally but by the breadth
of a hair.</p>

<p>Crammon could not get rid of the vision which he himself
had seen: the proud young wielder of the whip amid the
unleashed pack. He reflected deeply. “It is clear,” he said
to himself, “that I need no longer go to Cordova to find out
how the young muleteers laugh.”</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>At the castle of Waldleiningen there was a wine room in
which one could drink comfortably. In it Crammon and
Christian drank one evening to their deeper friendship. And
when the bottle was emptied of its precious vintage Crammon
proposed that, since it was a beautiful night, they should take
a turn in the park. Christian agreed.</p>

<p>In the moonlight they walked over the pebbles of the paths.
Trees and bushes swam in a silvery haze.</p>

<p>“Gossamers and the mist of autumn,” said Crammon.
“Quite as the poets describe it.”</p>

<p>“What poet?” Christian asked innocently.</p>

<p>“Almost any,” Crammon answered.</p>

<p>“Do you read poetry?” Christian was curious.</p>

<p>“Now and then,” Crammon answered, “when prose gets
stale. Thus I pay my debts to the world-spirit.”</p>

<p>They sat down on a bench under a great plantain. Christian
watched the scene silently for a while. Then he asked suddenly,
“Tell me, Bernard, what is this seriousness of life that
most people make such a fuss about?”</p>

<p>Crammon laughed softly to himself. “Patience, my dear
boy, patience! You’ll find out for yourself.”</p>

<p>He laughed again and folded his hands comfortably over his
abdomen. But over the lovely landscape and the lovely night
there fell a veil of melancholy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Christian wanted Crammon to accompany him and Alfred
Meerholz, the general’s son, to St. Moritz for the winter sports;
but Crammon had to attend Konrad von Westernach’s wedding
in Vienna. So they agreed to meet in Wiesbaden, where Frau
Wahnschaffe and Judith would join them in the spring.</p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe usually spent January and February in
the family’s ancestral home at Würzburg. She had many
guests there and so did not feel the boredom of the provincial
city. Wolfgang had been studying political science at the
university there; but at the end of the semester he was to go
to Berlin, pass his examination for the doctorate, and enter
the ministry of foreign affairs. Judith said to him sarcastically:
“You are a born diplomatist of the new school. The
moment you enter a room no one dares to jest any more.
It’s high time that you enlarge your sphere of activity.” He
answered: “You are right. I know that I shall yield my
place to a worthier one who knows better how to amuse you.”
“You are bitter,” Judith replied, “but what you say is true.”</p>

<p>When Christian arrived in Wiesbaden in April his mother
introduced him to the Countess Brainitz and to her niece,
Letitia von Febronius. The countess was ostensibly here to
drink the waters; but her purpose was commonly thought to
be the finding of a suitable match for her niece among the
young men of the country. She had succeeded, at all events,
in gaining the confidence of Frau Wahnschaffe, who was distrustful
and inaccessible. Judith was charmed by Letitia’s
loveliness.</p>

<p>Christian accompanied the young ladies on their walks and
rides, and the countess said to Letitia: “If I were you I’d fall
in love with that young man.” Letitia answered with her most
soulful expression: “If I were you, aunt, I’d be afraid of
doing so myself.”</p>

<p>Crammon arrived in an evil mood. Whenever one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
friends so far forgot himself as to marry, there came over him
an insidious hatred of mankind which darkened his soul for
weeks.</p>

<p>He was surprised when Christian told him of these new
friends, and wondered at the trick by which fate brought
him into the circle of Letitia’s life. He had a feeling that was
uncanny.</p>

<p>He was anything but delighted over the Countess Brainitz.
He was familiar with the genealogy and history of the dead
and living members of all the noble families of Europe, and
so was thoroughly informed concerning her. “In her youth,”
he reported, “she was an actress, one of those favourite ingénues
who attune souls of a certain sort poetically by a strident
blondness and by pulling at their aprons with touching
bashfulness. With these tricks she seduced in his time Count
Brainitz, a gentleman who had weak brains and a vigorous
case of gout. She thought he was rich. Later it turned out
that he was hopelessly in debt and lived on a pension allowed
him by the head of the house. On his death this pension
passed to her.”</p>

<p>She was blond no longer. Her hair was white and had a
metallic shimmer like spun glass. Its hue was premature,
no doubt, for she was scarcely over fifty. She was corpulent;
her body had a curious sort of carved rotundity; her face was
like an apple in its smooth roundness; it gleamed with a healthy
reddish tinge; and each feature&mdash;nose, mouth, chin, forehead&mdash;was
characterized by a certain harmless daintiness.</p>

<p>From the first moment she and Crammon found themselves
hopelessly at odds. She clasped her hands in despair over
everything he said, and all his doings enraged her. With her
feminine instinct she scented in him the adversary of all her
cunning plans; he saw in her another of those arch enemies
that, from time to time, spun for one of his friends the net
of marriage.</p>

<p>She asked him to dine merely because of Letitia’s insistence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The girl explained: “Even if you don’t like him in other
ways, aunt, you’ll approve of him as a guest. He’s very like
you in one way.” But Crammon’s dislike of the countess
robbed him of his usual appetite, so that the reconciliation
even on that plane did not occur. She herself ate three eggs
with mayonnaise, half of a duck, a large portion of roast beef,
four pieces of pastry, a plate full of cherries, and additional
trifles to pass the time. Crammon was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>After each course she washed her hands with meticulous
care, and when the meal was over drew her snow-white gloves
over her little, round fingers.</p>

<p>“All people are pigs,” she declared. “Nothing they come in
contact with remains clean. I guard myself as well as I can.”</p>

<p>Letitia sat through it all smiling in her own arch and tender
way, and her mere presence lent to the common things about
her a breath of romance.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Her estate having finally been sold at auction, and she
herself being quite without means, Frau von Febronius had
gone to live with her younger sister at Stargard in Pomerania.
In order to spare her daughter the spectacle of that
final débâcle she had sent the girl to the countess in Weimar.</p>

<p>The three sisters were all widowed. The one in Stargard
had been married to a circuit judge named Stojenthin. She
lived on her government pension and the income of a small
fortune that had been her dowry. She had two sons who
strolled through the world like gipsies, wrapped their sloth in
a loud philosophy, and turned to their aunt the countess
whenever they were quite at the end of all their resources.</p>

<p>The countess yielded every time. Both young men knew the
style of letter-writing that really appealed to her. “They will
get over sowing their wild oats,” said the countess. She had
been awaiting that happy consummation for years, and in the
meantime sent them food and money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not so simple to help Letitia. When the girl arrived
she possessed just three frocks which she had outgrown and a
little linen. The countess ordered robes from Vienna, and
fitted out her niece like an heiress.</p>

<p>Letitia permitted herself calmly to be adorned. The eyes
of men told her that she was charming. The countess said:
“You are destined for great things, my darling.” She took
the girl’s head between her two gloved hands and kissed her
audibly on the porcelain clearness of her forehead.</p>

<p>Nor was she satisfied with what she had done. She desired
to create a solid foundation and help her niece in a permanent
way. That desire brought to her mind the forest of Heiligenkreuz.</p>

<p>On the northern slope of the Röhn mountains there was a
piece of forest land having an area of from ten to twelve square
kilometres. For more than two decades it had been the
subject of litigation between her late husband and the head of
his house. The litigation was still going on. It had swallowed
huge sums and the countess’ prospects of winning were
slight. Nevertheless she felt herself to be the future owner of
the forest, and was so certain of her title that she determined
to present the forest to Letitia as a dowry and to record this
gift in proper legal form.</p>

<p>One evening she entered Letitia’s bedroom with a written
document in her hand. Over her filmy night dress she wore a
heavy coat of Russian sable and on her head she had a rubber
cap which was to protect her from the bacilli which, in her
opinion, whirred about in the darkness like bats.</p>

<p>“Take this and read it, my child,” she said with emotion,
and handed Letitia the document according to which, at the
end of the pending lawsuit, the forest of Heiligenkreuz was to
become the sole property of Letitia von Febronius.</p>

<p>Letitia knew the circumstances and the probable value of
the piece of paper. But she also knew that the countess had no
desire to deceive any one, but was honestly convinced of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
importance of the gift. So she exerted her mind and her tact
to exhibit a genuine delight. She leaned her cheek against
the mighty bosom of the countess and whispered entrancingly:
“You are inexpressibly kind, auntie. You really force a confession
from me.”</p>

<p>“What is it, darling?”</p>

<p>“I find life so wonderful and so lovely.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear, that’s what I want you to do,” said the
countess. “When one is young each day should be like a
bunch of freshly picked violets. It was so in my case.”</p>

<p>“I believe,” Letitia answered, “that my life will always be
like that.”</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>In the vicinity of Königstein in the Taunus mountains the
Wahnschaffes owned a little château which Frau Wahnschaffe
called Christian’s Rest and which was really the property of
her son. At first&mdash;he was still a boy&mdash;Christian had protested
against the name. “I don’t need any rest,” he had said.
And the mother had answered: “Some day the need of it will
come to you.”</p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe invited the countess to pass the month of
May at Christian’s Rest. It was a charming bit of country,
and the delight of the countess was uttered noisily.</p>

<p>Crammon, of course, came too. He observed the countess
with Argus eyes, and it annoyed him to watch the frequent
conversations between Christian and Letitia.</p>

<p>He sat by the fishpond holding his short, English pipe between
his lips. “We must get to Paris. That was our agreement.
You know that I promised you Eva Sorel. If you
don’t hurry more than fame is doing, you’ll be left out in the
cold.”</p>

<p>“Time enough,” Christian answered laughing and pulling a
reed from the water.</p>

<p>“Only sluggards say that,” Crammon grunted, “and it’s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
act of a sluggard to turn the head of a little goose of eighteen
and finally to be taken in by her. These young girls of good
family are fit for nothing in the world except for some poor
devil whose debts they can pay after the obligatory walk to
church. Their manipulations aren’t nearly as harmless as they
seem, especially when the girls have chaperones who are so
damnably like procuresses that the difference is less than between
my waistcoat buttons and my breeches buttons.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” Christian soothed his angry friend.
“There’s nothing to fear.”</p>

<p>He threw himself in the grass and thought of Adda Castillo,
the beautiful lion-tamer whom he had met in Frankfort.
She had told him she would be in Paris in June, and he meant
to stay here until then. He liked her. She was so wild and so
cold.</p>

<p>But he liked Letitia too. She was so dewy and so tender.
Dewy is what he called the liquidness of her eyes, the evasiveness
of her being. Daily in the morning he heard her in her
tower-room trilling like a lark.</p>

<p>He said: “To-morrow, Bernard, we’ll take the car and drive
over to see Adda Castillo and her lions.”</p>

<p>“Splendid!” Crammon answered. “Lions, that’s something
for me!” And he gave Christian a comradely thwack on the
shoulder.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Judith took Letitia with her to Homburg, and they visited
the fashionable shops. The rich girl bought whatever stirred
her fancy, and from time to time she turned to her friend and
said: “Would you like that? Do try it on! It suits you
charmingly.” Suddenly Letitia saw herself overwhelmed with
presents; and if she made even a gesture of hesitation, Judith
was hurt.</p>

<p>They crossed the market-place. Letitia loved cherries. But
when they came to the booth of the huckstress, Judith pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
forward and began to chaffer with the woman because she
thought the cherries too dear. The woman insisted on her
price, and Judith drew Letitia commandingly away.</p>

<p>She asked her: “What do you think of my brother Christian?
Is he very nice to you?” She encouraged Letitia, who
was frank, gave her advice and told her stories of the adventures
that Christian had had with women. His friends had
often entertained her with these romances.</p>

<p>But when Letitia, rocked into security by such sincere sympathy,
blushed, and first in silence and with lowered eyes, later
in sweet, low words, confessed something of her feeling for
Christian, Judith’s mouth showed an edge of scorn; she threw
back her head and showed the arrogance of a family that
deemed itself a race of kings.</p>

<p>Letitia felt that she had permitted herself to slip into a
net. She guarded herself more closely, and Crammon’s warnings
would have been needed no longer.</p>

<p>He offered her many. He sought to inspire in her a wholesome
fear of the bravery of youth, to attune her mood to the
older vintages among men who alone could offer a woman protection
and reliance. He was neither so clever nor so subtle as
he thought.</p>

<p>With all his jesuitical cultivation, in the end he felt that
something about this girl knocked at his heart. No posing to
himself helped. His thought spun an annoying web. Was he
to prove the truth of the foolish old legend concerning the
voice of the blood? Then he must escape from this haunted
place!</p>

<p>Letitia laughed at him. She said: “I’m only laughing because
I feel that way, Crammon, and because the sky to-day
is so blue. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“O nymph,” sighed Crammon. “I am a poor sinner.” And
he slunk away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe had decided to arrange a spring festival.
It was to illustrate all the splendour which was, on such occasions,
traditional in the house of Wahnschaffe. Councils were
held in which the major-domo, the housekeeper, the mistress’
companion and the countess took part. Frau Wahnschaffe
presided at the sessions with the severity of a judge. The
countess was interested principally in the question of food and
drink.</p>

<p>“My own darling,” she said to Letitia, “seventy-five lobsters
have been ordered, and two hundred bottles of champagne
brought up from the cellar. I am completely overwhelmed.
I haven’t been so overwhelmed since my wedding.”</p>

<p>Letitia stood there in her slenderness and smiled. The
words of the countess were music to her. She wanted to lend
wings to the days that still separated her from the festival.
She trembled whenever a cloud floated across the sky.</p>

<p>Often she scarcely knew how to muffle the jubilation in her
own heart. How wonderful, she thought, that one feels what
one feels and that things really are as they are. No poet’s
verse, no painter’s vision could vie with the power of her
imagination, which made all happenings pure gold and was
impenetrable to the shadow of disappointment. Her life was
rich&mdash;a pure gift of fate.</p>

<p>She merged into one the boundaries of dream and reality.
She made up her mind to dream as other people determine
to take a walk, and the dim and lawless character of her dream
world seemed utterly natural.</p>

<p>One day she spoke of a book that she had read. “It is
beautiful beyond belief.” She described the people, the scene,
and the moving fortunes of the book with such intensity and
enthusiasm that all who heard her were anxious to find the
book. But she knew neither its title nor the name of the
author. They asked her: “Where is the book? Where did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
you get it? When did you read it?” “Yesterday,” she replied.
“It must be somewhere about.” She hesitated. She
was begged to find it. And while she seemed to be reflecting
helplessly, Judith said to her: “Perhaps you only dreamed it
all.” She cast down her eyes and crossed her arms over her
bosom with an inimitable gesture and answered with a sense
of guilt: “Yes, it seems to me that I did merely dream it all.”</p>

<p>Christian asked Crammon: “Do you think that’s mere
affectation?”</p>

<p>“Not that,” answered Crammon, “and yet a bit of feminine
trickery. God has provided this sex with many dazzling
weapons wherewith to overthrow us.”</p>

<p>On the day of the festival Letitia wore a gown of white silk.
It was a little dancing frock with many delicate pleats in the
skirt and a dark blue sash about her hips. It looked like the
foam of fresh milk. When she looked into the mirror she
smiled excitedly as though she could not believe her eyes. The
countess ran about behind her and said: “Darling, be careful
of yourself!” But Letitia did not know what she meant.</p>

<p>There was a sense of intoxication in her when she spoke to
the men and women and girls. She had always been fond of
people; to-day they seemed irresistible to her. When she met
Judith in front of the pavillion, which was bathed in light, she
pressed her hands and whispered: “Could life be more beautiful?
I am frightened to think this night must end.”</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>On the meadow in front of the artificial water-fall Christian
and some young girls were playing hide and seek after the
manner of children. They all laughed as they played; young
men formed a circle about them, and watched them half
mockingly and half amused.</p>

<p>In the dark trees hung electric bulbs of green glass which
were so well concealed that the sward seemed to glow with a
light of its own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian played the game with a carelessness that annoyed
his partners. The girls wanted it to be taken more seriously,
and it vexed them that, in spite of his inattention, he caught
them with such ease. The young sister of Meerholz was among
them, and Sidonie von Gröben, and the beautiful Fräulein von
Einsiedel.</p>

<p>Letitia joined them. She went to the middle of the open
space. She let Christian come quite near her. Then she
eluded him more swiftly than he had thought possible. He
turned to the others, but always Letitia fluttered in front of
him. He sought to grasp her, but she was just beyond him.
Once he drove her against the box-tree hedge, but she slipped
into the foliage and was gone. Her movements, her running
and turning, her merry passion had something fascinating; she
called from the greenery with the little, laughing cries of a bird.
Now he lay in wait for her, and the onlookers became curious.</p>

<p>When she reappeared he feigned not to see her, but suddenly
he sped with incredible swiftness to the edge of the
fountain’s basin where she stood. But she was a shade swifter
still and leapt upon the rock, since all the other ways were
blocked, and jumped across the water lightly from stone to
stone. Her frock with its delicate pleats and loose sleeves
fluttered behind her, and when Christian started in pursuit
those below applauded.</p>

<p>Above it was dark. Letitia’s shoes became wet and her
foot slipped. But before Christian could grasp her she swung
herself upon a huge boulder between two tall pines as though
to defend herself there or else climb still farther. But her
footing failed her on the damp moss and she uttered a little
cry, for she knew that he had caught her now.</p>

<p>He had caught her, caught her as she fell, and now held her
in his arms. She was very quiet and tried to calm her fluttering
breath. Christian was breathing heavily too, and he
wondered why the girl was so still and silent. He felt her
lovely form and drew her a little closer with that suppressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
laughter of his that sounded so cold and arrogant. The
moonlight poured through the branches and made his face
seem of an extraordinary beauty. Letitia saw his strong, white
teeth gleam. She slipped from his arms, and put her own right
arm about the trunk of one of the trees.</p>

<p>Here was all that she had dreamed of. Here was the
breath of danger and the breath of desire, a wilderness and a
moonlit night, distant music and a secret meeting. But her
blood was quiet, for she was still a child.</p>

<p>Christian looked at the girl pliant against the tree; he
saw her dishevelled hair, her dewy eyes and lips; his eyes
followed the lines of her body and it seemed to him that he
could taste the coolness of her skin and the sweetness of her
innocent breath. He did not hesitate to take possession of his
booty.</p>

<p>Swiftly he sought her hand, when suddenly he became aware
of a toad that with loathsome sloth crept along Letitia’s white
frock, first across its hem, then upward toward her hip. He
grew pale and turned away. “The others are waiting. We
had better turn back,” he said and began to climb downward.</p>

<p>Letitia followed his movements with staring eyes. The fiery
emotion which had transformed her to her own vision into a
fairy being, a Diana or Melusina, turned to pain and she began
to weep. She did not know how to interpret what had happened,
and her sorrow lasted until, by a fanciful but charming
explanation, she had made it not more intelligible but more consoling
in its character. Then she dried her tears and smiled
again.</p>

<p>When Letitia arose the toad jumped into the moss. There
was no sound.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>On the afternoon before the departure of Crammon and
Christian there was a violent thunder storm. The two men
paced up and down in the upper corridor of the château and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
discussed their plans. In a pause between two peals of thunder
Crammon listened and said: “What a queer noise. Did you
hear it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Christian answered and they followed the direction
of the sound.</p>

<p>At the end of the gallery was a mirrored hall, the doors
of which were ajar. Crammon opened the door a little wider,
peered in and laughed softly in his throat. Christian peered
in too, above Crammon’s head, and joined in the laughter.</p>

<p>On the brilliantly polished floor of the room, which contained
no furniture except a few couches and armchairs ranged
along the walls, Letitia stood in little blue slippers and a pale
blue gown and played at ball. Her face had an expression
of ecstasy. The all but uninterrupted lightning that turned
the mirrors into yellow flame gave her play a ghostliness of
aspect.</p>

<p>Now she would toss the ball straight up, now she would
throw it against the wall between the mirrors and catch it as
it rebounded. At times she let it fall on the floor and clapped
her hands or spread out her arms until it leaped up to be
caught again. She turned and bent over and threw back her
head, or advanced a step or whispered, always smiling and
utterly absorbed. After the two had watched her for a while,
Crammon drew Christian away, for the lightning made him
nervous. He hated an electrical storm and had chosen to walk
in the gallery to escape it. He now lit his short pipe and asked
peevishly: “Do you understand the girl?”</p>

<p>Christian made no answer. Something lured him back to
the threshold of the hall in which Letitia was playing her
solitary game. But he remembered the toad on her white dress,
and a strange aversion arose in his heart.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>He did not love the memory of unpleasant events.</p>

<p>He did not like to speak of the past, whether it was pleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
or not. Nor did it please him to turn back upon a path. If
ever it became necessary he soon grew weary.</p>

<p>He did not care for people whose faces showed the strain of
intellectual labour, nor such as discoursed of books or of the
sciences. Nor did he love the pale or the hectic or the over-eager
or those who argued or insisted on the rightness of their
opinions. If any one defended an opinion opposed to his own
he smiled as courteously as though no difference existed. And
it was painful to him to be asked concerning his opinion
directly, and rather than bear the burden of a speech of
explanation he did not hesitate to feign ignorance.</p>

<p>If in large cities he was forced to walk or ride through the
quarters inhabited by the proletarian poor, he hastened as much
as possible, compressed his lips, breathed sparingly, and his
vexation would give his eyes a greenish glitter.</p>

<p>Once on the street a crippled beggar had caught hold of
his great coat. He returned home and presented the coat to
his valet. Even in his childhood he had refused to pass places
where ragged people were to be seen, and if any one told of
misery or need among men he had left the room, full of
aversion for the speaker.</p>

<p>He hated to speak or to hear others speak of the functions
or needs of the body&mdash;of sleep or hunger or thirst. The sight
of a human being asleep was repulsive to him. He did not like
emphatic leavetakings or the ceremonious greetings of those
who had been absent long. He disliked church bells and people
who prayed and all things that have to do with the exercise of
piety. He was quite without understanding for even the very
moderate Protestantism of his father.</p>

<p>He made no demand in words, but instinctively he chose to
bear no company but that of well-clad, care-free, and clear-seeing
people. Wherever he suspected secrets, hidden sorrows,
a darkened soul, a brooding tendency, inner or outer conflicts,
he became frosty and unapproachable and elusive. Therefore
his mother said: “Christian is a child of the sun and can thrive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
only in the sunlight.” She had made an early cult of keeping
far from him all that is turbid, distorted, or touched with pain.</p>

<p>On her desk lay the marble copy of a plaster-cast of Christian’s
hand&mdash;a hand that was not small, but sinewy and delicately
formed, capable of a strong grasp, but unused and quiet.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>On the trip from Hanau to Frankfort the automobile accident
occurred in which young Alfred Meerholz lost his life.
Christian was driving, but, as in the old days when the great
tree fell, he remained unharmed.</p>

<p>Crammon had accompanied Christian and Alfred as far as
Hanau. There he wanted to visit Clementine von Westernach
and then proceed to Frankfort by an evening train. Christian
had sent the chauffeur ahead to Frankfort the day before in
order to make certain purchases.</p>

<p>Christian at once drove at high speed, and toward evening,
as the road stretched out before him empty and free of obstacles,
he made the car fly. Alfred Meerholz urged him on,
glowing in the intoxication of speed. Christian smiled and let
the machine do its utmost.</p>

<p>The trees on both sides looked like leaping animals in a
photograph; the white riband of the road rolled shimmering
toward them and was devoured by the roaring car; the reddening
sky and the hills on the horizon seemed to swing in
circles; the air seethed in their ears; their bodies vibrated and
yearned to be whirled still more swiftly over an earth that
revealed all the allurement of its smoothness and rotundity.</p>

<p>Suddenly a black dot arose in the white glare of the road.
Christian gave a signal with his horn. The dot quickly assumed
human form. Again the signal shrieked. The figure did
not yield. Christian grasped the steering wheel more firmly.
Alfred Meerholz rose in his seat and shouted. It was too late
for the brake. Christian reversed the wheel energetically; it
went a trifle too far. There was a jolt, a concussion, a crash,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the groan of a splintering tree, a hissing and crackling of flame,
a clash and rattle of steel. It was over in a moment.</p>

<p>Christian lay stunned. Then he got up and felt his limbs
and body. He could think and he could walk. “All’s right,”
he said to himself.</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of the body of his friend. The young
man lay under the twisted and misshapen chassis with a crushed
skull. A little trickle of scarlet blood ran across the white
dust of the road. A few paces to one side stood in surprised
stupor the drunken man who had not made way.</p>

<p>People at once began gathering hurriedly from all directions.
There was a hotel near by. Christian answered many questions
briefly. The drunken man was taken in custody. A physician
came and examined young Meerholz’s body. It was placed
on a stretcher and carried into the hotel. Christian telegraphed
first to General Meerholz, then to Crammon.</p>

<p>His travelling bag had not been injured. While he was
changing his clothes, police officers arrived, and took down his
depositions concerning the accident. Then he went to the
dining-room and ordered a meal and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>He barely touched the food. The wine he gradually drank.</p>

<p>He saw himself standing in the dim hot-house awaiting
Letitia. She had come animated by her excitement. Languishing
and jesting she had whispered: “Well, my lord and
master?” And he had said to her: “Have the image of a
small toad made of gold, and wear the charm about your
throat in order to avert the evil magic.”</p>

<p>Her kiss seemed still to be burning on his lips.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock that night came Crammon, the faithful.
“I beg of you, my dear fellow, attend to all necessary arrangements
for me,” Christian said. “I don’t want to pass the night
here. Adda Castillo will be getting impatient.” He handed
Crammon his wallet.</p>

<p>Christian was thinking again of the romantic girl who, like
all of her temper, gave without knowing what she gave or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
whom, nor knew how long life is. But her kiss burned on his
lips. He could not forget it.</p>

<p>Crammon returned. “Everything is settled,” he said in a
business like way. “The car will be ready in fifteen minutes.
Now let us go and say farewell to our poor friend.”</p>

<p>Christian followed him. A porter led them to a dim storeroom
in which the body had been placed until the morrow.
A white cloth had been wrapped about the head. At the feet
crouched a cat with spotted fur.</p>

<p>Silently Crammon folded his hands. Christian felt a cold
breath on his cheeks, but there was no stirring in his breast.
When they came out into the open he said: “We must buy
a new car in Frankfort. We need not be back here before
noon to-morrow. The general cannot possibly arrive until
then.”</p>

<p>Crammon nodded. But a surprised look sought the younger
man, a look that seemed to ask: Of what stuff are you made?</p>

<p>About him, delicate, noble, proud, there was an icy air&mdash;the
infinitely glassy clarity that rests on mountains before the
dawn.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GLOBE ON THE FINGERTIPS OF AN ELF</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crammon</span> had been a true prophet. Ten months had sufficed
to fix the eyes of the world upon the dancer, Eva Sorel.
The great newspapers coupled her name with the celebrated
ones of the earth; her art was regarded everywhere as the fine
flower of its age.</p>

<p>All those to whose restless spiritual desires she had given
form and body were at her feet. The leaders of sorely driven
humanity drew a breath and looked up to her. The adorers
of form and the proclaimers of new rhythms vied for a smile
from her lips.</p>

<p>She remained calm and austere with herself. Sometimes the
noise of plaudits wearied her. Hard beset by the vast promises
of greedy managers, she felt not rarely a breath of horror.
Her inner vision, fixed upon a far and ideal goal, grew dim at
the stammered thanks of the easily contented. These, it
seemed to her, would cheat her. Then she fled to Susan
Rappard and was scolded for her pains.</p>

<p>“We wandered out to conquer the world,” said Susan, “and
the world has submitted almost without a struggle. Why
don’t you enjoy your triumph?”</p>

<p>“What my hands hold and my eyes grasp gives me no
cause to feel very triumphant yet,” Eva answered.</p>

<p>Susan lamented loudly. “You little fool, you’ve literally
gone hungry. Take your fill now!”</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” Eva replied, “what do you know of my
hunger?”</p>

<p>People besieged her threshold, but she received only a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and chose them carefully. She lived in a world of flowers.
Jean Cardillac had furnished her an exquisite house, the
garden terrace of which was like a tropical paradise. When
she reclined or sat there in the evening under the softened
light of the lamps, surrounded by her gently chatting friends,
whose most casual glance was an act of homage, she seemed
removed from the world of will and of the senses and to be
present in this realm of space only as a beautiful form.</p>

<p>Yet even those who thought her capable of any metamorphosis
were astonished when a sudden one came upon her and
when its cause seemed to be an unknown and inconsiderable
person. Prince Alexis Wiguniewski had introduced the man,
and his name was Ivan Michailovitch Becker. He was short
and homely, with deep-set Sarmatian eyes, lips that looked
swollen, and a straggling beard about his chin and cheeks.
Susan was afraid of him.</p>

<p>It was on a December night when the snow was banked up
at the windows that Ivan Michailovitch Becker had talked
with Eva Sorel for eight hours in the little room spread with
Italian rugs. In the adjoining room Susan walked shivering
up and down, wondering when her mistress would call for
help. She had an old shawl about her shoulders. From time
to time she took an almond from her pocket, cracked it with
her teeth, and threw the shells into the fireplace.</p>

<p>But on this night Eva did not go to bed, not even when the
Russian had left her. She entered her sleeping chamber and
let her hair roll down unrestrained so that it hid her head and
body, and she sat on a low stool holding her fevered cheeks
in her hollow hands. Susan, who had come to help her undress,
crouched near her on the floor and waited for a word.</p>

<p>At last her young mistress spoke. “Read me the thirty-third
canto of the <i>Inferno</i>,” she begged.</p>

<p>Susan brought two candles and the book. She placed the
candles on the floor and the volume on Eva’s lap. Then she
read with a monotonous sound of lamentation. But toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the end, especially where the poet speaks of petrified and frozen
tears, her clear voice grew firmer and more eloquent.</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="it" xml:lang="it"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Lo pianto stesso lì pianger non lascia;</div>
       <div class="verse">E il duol, che trova in sugli occhi rintoppo,</div>
       <div class="verse">Si volve in entro a far crescer l’ambascia:</div>
       <div class="verse">Chè le lagrime prime fanno groppo,</div>
       <div class="verse">E, sì come visiere di cristallo,</div>
       <div class="verse">Riempion sotto il ciglio tutto il coppo.”<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When she had finished she was frightened by the gleaming
moisture in Eva’s eyes.</p>

<p>Eva arose and bent her head far backward and closed her
eyes and said: “I shall dance all that&mdash;damnation in hell and
then redemption!”</p>

<p>Then Susan embraced Eva’s knees and pressed her cheek
against the bronze coloured silk of the girl’s garment and
murmured: “You can do anything you wish.”</p>

<p>From that night on Eva was filled with a more urgent passion,
and her dancing had lines in which beauty hovered on
the edge of pain. Ecstatic prophets asserted that she was
dancing the new century, the sunset of old ideas, the revolution
that is to come.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>When Crammon saw her again she showed the exquisitely
cultivated firmness of a great lady and forced his silent admiration.
And again there began that restless burning in his heart.</p>

<p>He talked to her about Christian Wahnschaffe and one
evening he brought him to her. In Christian’s face there was
something radiant. Adda Castillo had drenched it with her
passion. Eva felt about him the breath of another woman
and her face showed a mocking curiosity. For several seconds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the young man and the dancer faced each other like two
statues on their pedestals.</p>

<p>Crammon wondered whether Christian would ever thank him
for this service. He gave his arm to Susan, and the two walked
to and fro in the picture gallery.</p>

<p>“I hope your blond German friend is a prince,” said Susan
with her air of worry.</p>

<p>“He’s a prince travelling incognito in this vale of tears,”
Crammon answered. “You’ve made some stunning changes
here,” he added, gazing about him. “I’m satisfied with you
both. You are wise and know the ways of the world.”</p>

<p>Susan stopped and told him of what weighed upon her mind.
Ivan Michailovitch Becker came from time to time, and he
and Eva would talk together for many hours. Always after
that Eva would pass a sleepless night and answer no questions
and have a fevered gleaming in her eyes. And how was one
to forbid the marvellous child her indulgence in this mood?
Yet it might hold a danger for her. No stray pessimist with
awkward hands should be permitted to drag down as with
weights the delicate vibrations of her soul. “What do you
advise us to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>Crammon rubbed his smooth chin. “I must think it over,”
he said, “I must think it over.” He sat down in a corner
and rested his head on his hands and pondered.</p>

<p>Eva chatted with Christian. Sometimes she laughed at his
remarks, sometimes they seemed strange and astonishing to
her. Yet even where she thought her own judgment the better,
she was willing to hear and learn. She regarded his figure
with pleasure and asked him to get her, from a table in the
room, an onyx box filled with semi-precious stones. She
wanted to see how he would walk and move, how he would
stretch out his arm and hand after the box and give it to her.
She poured the stones into her lap and played with them.
She let them glide through her fingers, and said to Christian
with a smile that he should have become a dancer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>He answered naïvely that he was not fond of dancing in
general, but that he would think it charming to dance with
her. His speech amused her, but she promised to dance with
him. The stones glittered in her hands; a quiver of her mouth
betrayed vexation and pride but also compassion.</p>

<p>When she laughed it embarrassed Christian, and when she
was silent he was afraid of her thoughts. He had promised
to meet Adda Castillo at almost this hour. Yet he stayed
although he knew that she would be jealous and make a scene.
Eva seemed like an undiscovered country to him that lured
him on. Her tone, her gestures, her expression, her words, all
seemed utterly new. He could not tear himself away, and his
dark blue eyes clung to her with a kind of balked penetration.
Even when her friends came&mdash;Cardillac, Wiguniewski,
d’Autichamps&mdash;he stayed on.</p>

<p>But Eva had found a name for him. She called him Eidolon.
She uttered that name and played with its sound even as she
played with the mani-coloured jewels in her lap.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>One night Crammon entered a tavern in the outer boulevards.
It was called “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le pauvre Job</span>.” He looked about him
for a while and then sat down near a table at which several
young men of foreign appearance were conversing softly in a
strange tongue.</p>

<p>It was a group of Russian political refugees whose meeting
place he had discovered. Their chief was Ivan Michailovitch
Becker. Crammon pretended to be reading a paper while he
observed his man, whom he recognized from a photograph
which Prince Wiguniewski had shown him. He had never seen
so fanatical a face. He compared it with a smouldering fire
that filled the air with heat and fumes.</p>

<p>He had been told that Ivan Becker had suffered seven years
of imprisonment and five of Siberian exile and that many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
thousands of the young men of his people were wholly devoted
to him and would risk any danger or sacrifice at his bidding.</p>

<p>“Here they live in the most brilliant spot of the habitable
earth,” Crammon thought angrily, “and plan horrors.”</p>

<p>Crammon was an enemy of violent overthrow. If it did not
interfere with his own comfort, he was rather glad to see
the poor get the better of the over-fed bourgeois. He was
a friend of the poor. He took a condescending and friendly
interest in the common people. But he respected high descent,
opposed any breach of venerable law, and held his
monarch in honour. Every innovation in the life of the state
filled him with presentiments of evil, and he deprecated the
weakness of the governments that had permitted the wretched
parliaments to usurp their powers.</p>

<p>He knew that there was something threatening at the
periphery of his world. A stormwind from beyond blew out
lamps. What if they should all be blown out? Was not their
light and radiance the condition of a calm life?</p>

<p>He sat there in his seriousness and dignity, conscious of his
superiority and of his good deeds. As a representative of
order he had determined to appeal to the conscience of these
rebels if a suitable opportunity were to come. Yet what tormented
him was less an anxiety over the throne of the Tsar
than one over Eva Sorel. It was necessary to free the dancer
from the snares of this man.</p>

<p>An accident favoured his enterprise. One man after another
left the neighbouring table and at last Ivan Becker was left
alone. Crammon took his glass of absinthe and went over.
He introduced himself, referring to his friendship with Prince
Wiguniewski.</p>

<p>Silently Becker pointed to a chair.</p>

<p>True to his kind and condescending impulses Crammon
assumed the part of an amiable man who can comprehend
every form of human aberration. He approached his aim
with innocent turns of speech. He scarcely touched the poison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>ous
undergrowth of political contentions. He merely pointed
out with the utmost delicacy that, in the West of Europe, the
private liberty of certain lofty personages would have to remain
untouched unless force were to be used to oppose force.
Gentle as his speech was, it was an admonition. Ivan smiled
indulgently.</p>

<p>“Though the whole sky were to flare with the conflagrations
that devastate your Holy Russia,” Crammon said with conscious
eloquence, and the corners of his mouth seemed to bend
in right angles toward his square chin, “we will know how to
defend what is sacred to us. Caliban is an impressive beast.
But if he were to lay his hands on Ariel he might regret it.”</p>

<p>Again Ivan Michailovitch smiled. His expression was
strangely mild and gentle, and gave his homely, large face an
almost feminine aspect. He listened as though desiring to be
instructed.</p>

<p>Crammon was encouraged. “What has Ariel to do with your
misery? He looks behind him to see if men kiss the print of his
feet. He demands joy and glory, not blood and force.”</p>

<p>“Ariel’s feet are dancing over open graves,” Ivan Michailovitch
said softly.</p>

<p>“Your dead are safe at peace,” Crammon answered. “With
the living we shall know how to deal.”</p>

<p>“We are coming,” said Ivan Michailovitch still more softly.
“We are coming.” It sounded mysterious.</p>

<p>Half fearfully, half contemptuously Crammon looked at the
man. After a long pause he said as though casually, “At
twelve paces I can hit the ace of hearts four times out of
five.”</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch nodded. “I can’t,” he said almost
humbly, and showed his right hand, which he usually concealed
skilfully. It was mutilated.</p>

<p>“What happened to your hand?” Crammon asked in pained
surprise.</p>

<p>“When I lay in the subterranean prison at Kazan a keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
forged the chain about me too hard,” Ivan Michailovitch
murmured.</p>

<p>Crammon was silent, but the other went on: “Perhaps you’ve
noticed too that it’s difficult for me to speak. I lived alone too
long in the desert of snow, in a wooden hut, in the icy cold.
I became unused to words. I suffered. But that is only a
single word: suffering. How can one make its content clear?
My body was but a naked scaffolding, a ruin. But my heart
grew and expanded. How can I tell it? It grew to be so great,
so blood red, so heavy that it became a burden to me in the
fearful attempt at flight which I finally risked. But God
protected me.” And he repeated softly, “God protected me.”</p>

<p>In Crammon’s mind all ideas became confused. Was this
man with his gentle voice and the timid eyes of a girl the
murderous revolutionary and hero of possible barricades whom
he had expected to meet? In his surprise and embarrassment
he became silent.</p>

<p>“Let us go,” said Ivan Michailovitch. “It is late.” He
arose and threw a coin on the table and stepped out into the
street at Crammon’s side. There he began again, hesitatingly
and shyly: “I don’t want to presume to judge, but I don’t
understand these people here. They are so certain of themselves
and so reasonable. Yet that reasonableness is the completest
madness. A beast of the field that feels the tremor
of an earthquake and flees is wiser. And another thing: Ariel,
the being whom you strive so eloquently to protect, has no
moral responsibility. No one thinks of blaming it. What is it
but form, gesture, beauty? But don’t you think that the
darker hue and deeper power that are born of the knowledge
of superhuman suffering might raise art above the interests of
idle sybarites? We need heralds who stand above the idioms
of the peoples; but those are possibilities that one can only
dream of with despair in one’s heart.” He nodded a brief
good-night and went.</p>

<p>Crammon felt like a man who had merrily gone out in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
light spring suit but had been overtaken by a rainstorm and
returns drenched and angry. The clocks were striking two.
A lady of the Opéra Comique had been waiting for him since
midnight; the key to her apartment was in his pocket. But
when he came to the bridge across the Seine he seized the key
and, overcome by a violent fit of depression, flung it into the
water.</p>

<p>“Sweet Ariel!” He spoke softly to himself. “I kiss the
prints of your feet.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Adda Castillo noticed that Christian was turning from her.
She had not expected that, at least not so soon; and as she
saw him grow cold, her love increased. But his indifference
kept pace with her ardour, and so her passionate heart lost all
repose.</p>

<p>She was accustomed to change and, in spite of her youth,
had been greatly loved. She had never demanded fidelity
before nor practised it. But this man was more to her than
any other had been.</p>

<p>She knew who was robbing her of him; she had seen the
dancer. When she called Christian to account he frankly admitted
as a fact what she had mentioned only as a suspicion
in the hope of having it denied. She instituted comparisons.
She found that she was more beautiful than Eva Sorel, more
harmoniously formed, racier and more impassioned. Her
friends confirmed her in this opinion; and yet she felt that the
other had some advantage to which she must yield. Neither
she nor her flatterers could give it a name. But she felt herself
the more deeply affronted.</p>

<p>She adorned her person, she practised all her arts, she unfolded
all sides of her wild and entrancing temperament. It
was in vain. Then she vowed vengeance and clenched her
fists and stamped. Or else she begged and lay on her knees
before him and sobbed. One method was as foolish as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
other. He was surprised and asked calmly: “Why do you
throw aside all dignity?”</p>

<p>One day he told her that they must separate. She turned
very white and trembled. Suddenly she took a revolver from
her pocket, aimed at him and fired twice. He heard the bullets
whiz past his head, one on either side. They hit the mirror
and smashed it, and the fragments clattered to the floor.</p>

<p>People rushed to the door. Christian went out and explained
that the noise meant no harm and was due to mere
carelessness. When he returned he found Adda Castillo lying
on the sofa with her face buried in the pillows. He showed
no fright and no sense of the danger that he had escaped.
He thought merely how annoying such things were and how
banal. He took his hat and stick and left the room.</p>

<p>It was long before Adda Castillo arose. She went to the
mirror and shivered. There was but one fragment of it left
in the frame. But by the help of this fragment she smoothed
her coal-black hair.</p>

<p>A few days later she came to see Christian. On the card
that she had sent in she begged for an interview of but five
minutes. Her farewell performance in Paris was to take place
that evening and she begged him to be present at the circus.
He hesitated. The glowing eyes in the wax-white face were
fixed on him in a mortal terror. It made him uncomfortable,
but something like pity stirred within him and he agreed to
come.</p>

<p>Crammon accompanied him. They entered just as Adda
Castillo’s act was about to begin. The cage with the lions
was being drawn into the arena. Their seats were near the
front. “They’re getting to be a bit of a bore, these lions,”
Crammon grumbled and watched the audience through his
glasses.</p>

<p>Adda Castillo in scarlet fleshings, her dark hair loose, her lips
and cheeks heavily rouged, entered the cage of the lionness and
her four cubs. Perhaps something in the woman’s bearing irri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>tated
Teddy, the youngest lion. At all events he backed before
her, roared and lifted his paw. Adda Castillo whistled and
commanded him with a gesture to leave the mother animal.
Teddy crouched and hissed.</p>

<p>At that moment Adda, instead of mastering the beast with
her glance, turned to the public and searched the front rows
with her sparkling eyes. Teddy leaped on her shoulder. She
was down. One cry arose from many throats. The people
jumped up. Many fled. Others grew pale but stared in evil
fascination at the cage.</p>

<p>At that moment Trilby, the mother animal, came forward
with a mighty leap, not to attack her mistress but to save her
from the cubs. With powerful blows of her paw she thrust
Teddy aside and stood protectingly over the girl who was
bleeding from many wounds. But the cubs, greedy for blood,
threw themselves on their mother and beat and bit her back
and flanks, so that she retreated howling to a corner and left
the girl to her fate.</p>

<p>The keepers had rushed up with long spears and hooks, but
it was too late. The cubs had bitten their teeth deep into the
body of Adda Castillo and torn her flesh to shreds. They did
not let go until formaldehyde was sprinkled on her scattered
remains.</p>

<p>The cries of pity and terror, the weeping and wringing of
hands, the thronging at the gates and the noise of the circus
men, the image of a clown who stood as though frozen on a
drum, a horse that trotted in from the stables, the sight of
the bloody, unspeakably mutilated body in its dripping shreds&mdash;none
of all this penetrated in any connected or logical form
the consciousness of Christian. It seemed to him mere confusion
and ghostly whirl. He uttered no sound. Only his
face was pale. His face was very pale.</p>

<p>In the motor car on their way to Jean Cardillac, with whom
they were to dine, Crammon said: “By God, I wouldn’t like to
die between the jaws of a lion. It is a cruel death and an igno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>minious
one.” He sighed and surreptitiously looked at
Christian.</p>

<p>Christian had the car stop and asked Crammon to present
his excuses to Cardillac. “What are you going to do?”
Crammon asked in his astonishment.</p>

<p>And Christian replied that he wanted to be alone, that he
must be alone for a little.</p>

<p>Crammon could scarcely control himself. “Alone? You?
What for?” But already Christian had disappeared in the
crowd.</p>

<p>“He wants to be alone! What an insane notion!” Crammon
growled. He shook his head and bade the chauffeur drive
on. He drew up the collar of his greatcoat and dedicated a last
thought to the unhappy Adda Castillo without assigning any
guilt or blame to his friend.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>“Eidolon is not as cheerful as usual,” Eva said to Christian.
“What has happened? Eidolon mustn’t be sad.”</p>

<p>He smiled and shook his head. But she had heard of the
happening at the circus and also knew in what relation Adda
Castillo had stood to Christian.</p>

<p>“I had a bad dream,” he said and told her of it.</p>

<p>“I dreamed that I was in a railroad station and wanted to
take a train. Many trains came in but roared and passed with
indescribable swiftness. I wanted to ask after the meaning of
this. But when I turned around I saw behind me in a semi-circle
an innumerable throng. And all these people looked at
me; but when I approached them, they all drew away slowly
and silently with outstretched arms. All about in that monstrous
circle they drew silently away from me. It was horrible.”</p>

<p>She passed her hand over his forehead to chase the horror
away. But she recognized the power of her touch and was
frightened by her image in his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>When from the stage where she was bowing amid the flowers
and the applause she perceived the touch of his glances she
felt in them a threat of enslavement. When on his arm she
approached a table and heard the delighted whisper of people
at them both, she seemed to herself the victim of a conspiracy,
and a hesitation crept into her bearing. When Crammon, practising
a strange self-abnegation, spoke of Christian in extravagant
terms, and Susan, even in their nocturnal talks, grew
mythical concerning his high descent, when Cardillac grew restless
and Cornelius Ermelang, the young German poet who
adored her, asked questions with his timid eyes&mdash;when these
things came to pass she feigned coldness and became unapproachable.</p>

<p>She scolded Susan, she made fun of Crammon, she laughed at
Jean Cardillac, jestingly she bent her knee to the poet. She
confused her entire court of painters, politicians, journalists,
and dandies with her incomprehensible mimicry and flexibility,
and said that Eidolon was only an illusion and a symbol.</p>

<p>Christian did not understand this&mdash;neither this nor her
swift withdrawals from him, and then her turning back and
luring him anew. A passionate gesture would arise and suddenly
turn to reproof, and one of delight would turn into
estrangement. It was useless to try to bind her by her own
words. She would join the tips of her fingers and turn her
head aside and look out of the corners of her eyes at the floor
with a cool astuteness.</p>

<p>Once he had driven her into a corner, but she called Susan,
leaned her head against the woman’s shoulder and whispered in
her ear.</p>

<p>Another time, in order to test her feeling, he spoke of his
trip to England. With charmingly curved hands she gathered
up her skirt and surveyed her feet.</p>

<p>Another time, in the light and cheerful tone they used to
each other, he reproached her with making a fool of him. She
crossed her arms and smiled mysteriously, wild and subdued at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
once. She looked as though she had stepped out of a Byzantine
mosaic.</p>

<p>He knew the freedom of her life. But when he sought for
the motives that guided her, he had no means of finding them.</p>

<p>He knew nothing of the intellectual fire of the dancer, but
took her to be a woman like any other. He did not see that
that which is, in other women, the highest stake and the
highest form of life, needed to be in her life but a moment’s
inclination and a moment’s gliding by. He did not grasp the
form in her, but saw the contour melt in glimmering change.
Coming from the sensual regions of one possessed like Adda
Castillo, he breathed here an air purified of all sultriness, which
intoxicated but also frightened him, which quickened the beat
of the heart but sharpened the vision.</p>

<p>Everything was fraught with presages of fate: when she
walked beside him; when they rode side by side in the Bois de
Boulogne; when they sat in the twilight and he heard her
clear and childlike voice; when in the palm garden she teased
her little monkeys; when she listened to Susan at the piano and
let the bright stones glide through her fingers.</p>

<p>One evening when he was leaving he met Jean Cardillac at
the gate. They greeted each other. Then involuntarily Christian
stopped and looked after the man, whose huge form threw
a gigantic shadow on the steps. Invisible little slaves seemed to
follow this shadow, all bearing treasures to be laid at Eva’s
feet.</p>

<p>An involuntary determination crystallized in him. It seemed
important to measure his strength against this shadow’s. He
turned back and the servants let him pass. Cardillac and Eva
were in the picture gallery. She was curled up on a sofa, rolled
up almost like a snake. Not far from those two, on a low stool,
sat Susan impassive but with burning eyes.</p>

<p>“You’ve promised to drive with me to the races at Longchamp,
Eva,” said Christian. He stood by the door to show
that he desired nothing else.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Eidolon. Why the reminder?” answered Eva without
moving, but with a flush on her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Quite alone with me&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Eidolon, quite alone.”</p>

<p>“My dream suddenly came back to me, and I thought of
that train that wouldn’t stop.”</p>

<p>She laughed at the naïve and amiable tone of his words. Her
eyes grew gentle and she laid her head back on the pillows.
Then she looked at Cardillac, who arose silently.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Christian and went.</p>

<p>It was during these days that Denis Lay had arrived in
Paris. Crammon had expected him and now welcomed him
with ardour. “He is the one man living who is your equal and
who competes with you in my heart,” Crammon had said to
Christian.</p>

<p>Denis was the second son of Lord Stainwood. He had had
a brilliant career at Oxford, where his exploits had been the
talk of the country. He had formed a new party amid the
undergraduates, whose discussions and agitations had spared no
time-honoured institutions. At twenty-two he was not only a
marksman, hunter, fisherman, sailor, and boxer, but a learned
philologist. He was handsome, wealthy, radiant with life, and
surrounded by a legend of mad pranks and by a halo of distinction
and elegance&mdash;the last and finest flower of his class
and nation.</p>

<p>Christian recognized his qualities without envy and the
two became friends at once. One evening he was entertaining
Cardillac, Crammon, Wiguniewski, Denis Lay, the Duchess
of Marivaux, and Eva Sorel. And it was on this occasion that
Eva, in the presence of the whole company, lightly broke the
promise that she had given him.</p>

<p>Denis had expressed the desire to take her to Longchamp
in his car. Eva became aware of Christian’s look. It was
watchful, but still assured. She held a cluster of grapes in
her hand. When she had placed the fruit back on the plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
before her, she had betrayed him. Christian turned pale. He
felt that she needed no reminder. She had chosen. It was
for him to be quiet and withdraw.</p>

<p>Eva took up the cluster of grapes again. Lifting it on the
palm of her hand she said with that smile of dreamy enthusiasm
which seemed heartless to Christian now: “Beautiful
fruit, I shall leave you until I am hungry for you.”</p>

<p>Crammon raised his glass and cried: “Whoever wishes to
do homage to the lady of our allegiance&mdash;drink!”</p>

<p>They all drank to Eva, but Christian did not lift his eyes.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>On the next night after her performance, Eva had invited
several friends to her house. She had danced the chief rôle in
the new pantomime called “The Dryads,” and her triumph had
been very great. She came home in a cloud of flowers. Later
a footman brought in a basket heaped with cards and letters.</p>

<p>She sank into Susan’s arms, happy and exhausted. Every
pore of her glowed with life.</p>

<p>Crammon said: “There may be insensitive scoundrels in
the world. But I think it’s magnificent to watch a human
being on the very heights of life.”</p>

<p>For this saying Eva, with graceful reverence, gave him a
red rose. And the burning in his breast became worse and
worse.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that Christian and Denis were to have
a fencing bout. Eva had begged for it. She hoped not only
to enjoy the sight, but to learn something for her own art
from the movements of the two young athletes.</p>

<p>The preparations had been completed. In the round hall
hung with tapestries, Christian and Denis faced each other.
Eva clapped her hands and they assumed their positions. For
a while nothing was heard except their swift, muffled, and
rhythmical steps and the clash of their foils. Eva stood
erect, all eye, drinking in their gestures. Christian’s body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
was slenderer and more elastic than the Englishman’s. The
latter had more strength and freedom. They were like
brothers of whom one had grown up in a harsh, the other in
a mild climate; the one self-disciplined and upheld by a long
tradition of breeding, the other cradled in tenderness and
somewhat uncertain within. The one was all marrow, the other
all radiance. In virility and passion they were equals.</p>

<p>Crammon was in the seventh heaven of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>When the combat was nearly at an end, Cornelius Ermelang
appeared, and with him Ivan Michailovitch Becker. Eva had
asked Ermelang to read a poem. He and Becker had known
each other long, and when he had found the Russian walking to
and fro near the gate he had simply brought him up. It was
the first time that Ivan showed himself to Eva’s other friends.</p>

<p>Both were silent and sat down.</p>

<p>Christian and Denis had changed back to their usual garments,
and now Ermelang was to read. Susan sat down near
Becker and observed him attentively.</p>

<p>Cornelius Ermelang was a delicate creature and of a repulsive
ugliness. He had a steep forehead, watery blue eyes
with veiled glances, a pendulous nether lip, and a yellowish
wisp of beard at the extreme end of his chin. His voice was
extraordinarily gentle and soft, and had something of the sing-song
rhythm of a preacher’s.</p>

<p>The name of the poem was “Saint Francis and Why Men
Followed Him,” and its content was in harmony with the
traditions and the writings.</p>

<p>Once upon a time Saint Francis was tarrying in the convent
of Portiuncula with Brother Masseo of Marignano, who
was himself a very holy man and could speak beautifully and
wisely concerning God. And for this reason Saint Francis
loved him greatly. Now one day Saint Francis returned
from the forest where he had been praying, and just as
he emerged from the trees Brother Masseo came to meet him
and said: “Why thee rather than another? Why thee?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Saint Francis asked: “What is the meaning of thy words?”
Brother Masseo replied: “I ask why all the world follows thee,
and why every man would see thee and listen to thee and obey
thee. Thou art not goodly to look upon, nor learned, nor of
noble blood. Why is it that all the world follows thee?”
When Saint Francis heard this he was glad in his heart, and he
raised his face to Heaven and stood without moving for a long
space, because his spirit was lifted up to God. But when
he came to himself again, he threw himself upon his knees
and praised and thanked God, and full of a devout passion
turned to Brother Masseo and spoke: “Wouldst thou know
why they follow me, and me always, and me rather than another?
This grace has been lent to me by the glance of
Almighty God Himself which rests on the good and the evil
everywhere. For His holy eyes saw among the sinners on
earth none who was more wretched than I, none who was less
wise and able, nor any who was a greater sinner. For the
miraculous work that He had it in His heart to bring about He
found no creature on earth so mean as I. And therefore did
He choose me to put to shame the world with its nobility and
its pride and its strength and its beauty and its wisdom, in
order that it might be known that all power and goodness
proceed from Him alone and from no created thing, and that no
one may boast before His face. But whoever boast, let him
boast in the Lord.” And Brother Masseo was frightened at
this answer, which was so full of humility and spoken with
such fervour.</p>

<p>And the poem related how Brother Masseo went into the
forest out of which Saint Francis had come, and how tones as
of organ music came from the tops of the trees and formed
more and more clearly the question: Wouldst thou know why?
Wouldst thou know? And he cast himself upon the earth,
upon the roots and stones, and kissed the roots and stones and
cried out: “I know why! I know why!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The stanzas had a sweetness and an inner ecstasy; their
music was muffled and infinitely fluid, with many but shy and
half-hidden rimes.</p>

<p>“It is beautiful,” said Denis Lay, who understood German
perfectly.</p>

<p>And Crammon said: “It is like an old painting on glass.”</p>

<p>“What I admire most,” said Denis, “is that it brings the
figure of Saint Francis very close to one with that magical
quality of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cortesia</i> which he possessed above all other saints.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Cortesia?</i> What does it mean exactly?” Wiguniewski
asked. “Does it mean a humble and devout courtesy?”</p>

<p>Eva arose. “That is it,” she said, “just that.” And she
made an exquisite gesture with both hands. All looked at
her, and she added: “To give what is mine, and only to
appear to take what is another’s, that is <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cortesia</i>.”</p>

<p>During all this conversation Christian had withdrawn himself
from the others. Aversion was written on his face. Even
during the reading he had hardly been able to keep his seat.
He did not know what it was that rebelled in him and irritated
him supremely. A spirit of mockery and scorn was in him
and fought for some expression. With assumed indifference
he called out to Denis Lay, and began to talk to him about
the stallion that Lay desired to sell and Christian to possess.
He had offered forty thousand francs for it. Now he offered
forty-five thousand, and his voice was so loud that all could
hear him. Crammon stepped to his side as though to guard
him.</p>

<p>“Eidolon!” Eva cried suddenly.</p>

<p>Christian looked at her with a consciousness of guilt. Their
eyes met. The others became silent in surprise.</p>

<p>“The beast is worth that anywhere,” Christian murmured,
without taking his eyes from Eva.</p>

<p>“Come, Susan,” Eva turned to the woman, and about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
mouth curled an expression of bitterness and scorn. “He
knows how to fence and how to trade horses. Of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cortesia</i> he
knows nothing. Good-night, gentlemen.” She bowed and
slipped through the green hangings.</p>

<p>In consternation the company scattered.</p>

<p>When she had reached her room Eva threw herself into a
chair, and in bitterness of spirit hid her face in her hands.
Susan crouched near her on the floor, waiting and wondering.
When a quarter of an hour had passed she arose and took
the clasps out of Eva’s hair and began to comb it.</p>

<p>Eva was passive. She was thinking of her own master and
of what he had taught her.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>This is what her master had taught her: Train your body
to fear and obey the spirit. What you grant the body beyond
its necessity makes you its slave. Never be the one seduced.
Seduce others, and your way will always be your own to
see. Be a secret to others or you grow vulgar to yourself.
Give yourself wholly only to your work. Passions of sense
lay waste the heart. What one man truly receives of another
is never the fullness of the hour or the soul, but lees and dregs
that are fructified late and unconsciously.</p>

<p>She had been only twelve, when, persuaded by jugglers and
answering the call of her fate, she had left her home in a
remote little Franconian town. She was very far from her
master then. But the way was pre-determined.</p>

<p>She never lost herself. She glided over difficulties and degradations
as the chamois does over boulders and abysses.
Whoever saw her amid the strolling jugglers held her to be
the kidnapped child of distinguished parents. She was, as a
matter of fact, the daughter of an obscure musician named
Daniel Nothafft and of a servant girl. A dreamy feeling of
pity and admiration united her to her father; her mother she
had never known, and so discarded her ill-sounding name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>She was accustomed to pass the night in tents and barns.
In towns by the sea she had often slept in the shelter of
cliffs wrapped in a blanket. She knew the nocturnal sky with
its clouds and stars. She had slept on straw amid the animals
too, near asses and dogs, and on the rickety, over-burdened
cart had ridden on the roadways through rain and snow. It
was a romantic life that recalled another age.</p>

<p>She had had to sew her own costumes and to go through her
daily and difficult exercises under the whip of the chief of
the jugglers. But she learned the language of the country, and
secretly bought at fairs in cities the books of the poets who
had used it. Secretly she read, sometimes from pages torn out
of the volumes and thus more easily concealed, Béranger,
Musset, Victor Hugo, and Verlaine.</p>

<p>She walked the tight rope which, without any protective
net below, was slung from gable to gable across the market-places
of villages, and she walked as securely as on the ground.
Or she acted as the partner of a dancing she-bear or with five
poodles who turned somersaults. She was a trapeze artist
too, and her greatest trick was to leap from one horse in full
gallop to another. When she did that the hurdy-gurdy stopped
its music so that the spectators might realize what a remarkable
thing they were seeing. She carried the collection plate
along the rope, and her glance persuaded many a one to dip
into his pocket who had meant to slink away.</p>

<p>It was in villages and little towns lying along the Rhône
that she first became aware among the spectators of a man
who dragged himself about with difficulty on two crutches. He
followed the troupe from place to place, and since his whole
attention was fixed on Eva, it was evident that he did so for
her sake.</p>

<p>It was after two years of this wandering life that in Lyons
she was seized with typhoid fever. Her companions sent her
to a hospital. They could not wait, but the chief juggler was
to return after a period and fetch her. When he did return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
she was just beginning to convalesce. Suddenly by her bed-side
she also saw the man with the crutches. He took the
juggler aside and one could see that they were talking about
money. From the pressure of her old master’s hand Eva knew
that she saw him for the last time.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>The man with the crutches was named Lucas Anselmo Rappard.
He saved Eva and awakened her. He taught her her
art. He took her under his care, and this care was tyrannical
enough. He did not set her free again until she had become all
that he had desired to make of her.</p>

<p>He had long lived in retirement at Toledo, because there were
three or four paintings in the Spanish city that rewarded him
for his isolation from the busy world. Also he found that the
sun of Spain warmed him through and through, and that he
liked the folk.</p>

<p>In spite of his crippled state he journeyed northward once a
year to be near the ocean. And like the men of old he went
slowly from place to place. His sister Susan was his unfailing
companion. It was on one of his return journeys that he
had seen Eva quite by chance. The village fairs of this region
had long attracted him. And there he found unexpectedly
something that stimulated his creative impulse. It was a
sculptor’s inspiration. He saw the form in his mind’s eye.
Here was the material ready to his hand. The sight of Eva
relit an idea in him to which he had long despaired of giving
a creative embodiment.</p>

<p>First he called the whole matter a whim. Later, absorbed
in his task, he knew the passion of a Pygmalion.</p>

<p>He was forty at that time or a little more. His beardless face
was thick-boned, peasant-like, brutal. But on closer observation
the intellect shone through the flesh. The greenish-grey
eyes, very deep-set in their hollows, had so compelling a glance
that they surprised and even frightened others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>This remarkable man had an origin and a fate no less remarkable.
His father had been a Dutch singer, his mother a
Dalmatian. They had drifted to Courland, where an epidemic
killed both at almost the same time. The two children had
been taken into the ballet school of the theatre at Riga.
Lucas Anselmo justified the most brilliant hopes. His incomparable
elasticity and lightness surpassed anything that had yet
been seen in a young dancer. At seventeen he danced at the
Scala in Milan, and roused the public to a rare exhibition of
enthusiasm. But his success was out of its due time&mdash;too late
or too early. His whole personality had something strange
and curiously transplanted; and soon he became estranged
from himself and from the inner forces of his life. At twenty
a morbid melancholy seized him.</p>

<p>He happened at that time to be dancing in Petrograd. A
young but lately married lady of the court fell in love with
him. She persuaded him to visit her on a certain night in a
villa beyond the city. But her husband had been warned.
He pleaded the necessity of going on a journey to make his
wife the more secure. Then with his servants he broke into
the lovers’ chamber, had the lad beaten cruelly, then tied,
and thrown naked into the snow. Here in the bitter cold the
unhappy dancer lay for six hours.</p>

<p>A dangerous illness and a permanent crippling of his legs
were the result of this violent adventure. Susan nursed him
and never left him for an hour. She had always admired
and loved him. Now she worshipped him. He had already
earned a little fortune, and an inheritance from his mother’s
side increased it, so he was enabled to live independently.</p>

<p>A new man developed in him. His deformity gave to his
mind the resilience and power that had been his body’s. In
a curious way he penetrated all the regions of modern life;
and above pain, disappointment, and renunciation, he built a
road from the senses to the mind. In his transformation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a dancer to a cripple he divined a deep significance. He now
sought an idea and a law; and the harsh contrast between external
calm and inner motion, of inner calm and outward restlessness,
seemed to him important in any interpretation of
mankind and of his age.</p>

<p>At twenty-two he set himself to study Latin, Greek, and
Sanskrit. He became a thorough student, and took courses at
the German universities. And this strange student, who
dragged himself along on crutches, was often an object of
curiosity. At the age of thirty he travelled with Susan to
India, and lived for four years at Delhi and Benares. He
associated with learned Brahmins and received their mystic
teachings. Once he had sight of an almost legendary Thibetan
priest, who had lived in a cave of the mountains for eighty
years, and whom the eternal darkness had blinded, but whom
the eternal loneliness had made a saint. The sight of the
centenarian moved him, for the first time in his life, to tears.
He now understood saintliness and believed in it. And this
saint danced: he danced at dawn, turning his blinded eyes to
the sun.</p>

<p>He saw the religious festivals in the temple cities on the
Ganges, and felt the nothingness of life and the indifference of
death when he saw those who had died of pestilence float by
hundreds down the stream. He had himself carried into
primeval forests and jungles, and saw everywhere in the inextricable
coil of life and death each taking the other’s form and
impulse&mdash;decay becoming birth and putrefaction giving life.
He was told of the marble-built city of a certain king, in which
dwelled only dancing girls taught by priests. When their
flesh faded and their limbs lost their agility, they were slain.
They had vowed chastity, and none was permitted to survive
the breaking of that vow. He approached the fabled city but
could not gain admission. At night he saw the fires on its roofs,
and heard the songs of its virginal dancers. Now and then it
seemed to him that he heard a cry of death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>This night, with its fires and songs, its unseen dancers and
uncertain cries, stored up new energies within his soul.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>He took Eva with him to Toledo. He had rented a house
there in which, men said, the painter El Greco had once
dwelled.</p>

<p>The building was a grey cube, rather desolate within. Cats
shared the dwelling, and owls, bats, and mice.</p>

<p>Several rooms were filled with books, and these books became
Eva’s silent friends in the years that came now, and during
which she saw almost no one but Rappard and Susan.</p>

<p>In this house she learned to know loneliness and work and
utter dedication to a task.</p>

<p>She entered the house full of fear of him who had forced
her into it. His speech and behaviour intimidated her so that
she had terror-stricken visions when she thought of him. But
Susan did all in her power to soothe the girl.</p>

<p>Susan would relate stories concerning her brother at morning
or in the evening hours, when Eva lay with her body
desperately exhausted, too exhausted often to sleep. She had
not been spoiled. The life with the troupe of jugglers had
accustomed her to severe exertions. But the ceaseless drill, the
monotonous misery of the first few months, in which everything
seemed empty and painful, without allurement or brightness
or intelligible purpose, made her ill and made her hate
her own limbs.</p>

<p>It was Susan’s hollow voice that besought her to be patient;
it was Susan who massaged her arms and legs, who carried
her to bed and read to her. And she described her brother,
who in her eyes was a magician and an uncrowned king, and
on whose eyes and breath she hung, described him through
his past, which she retold in its scenes and words, at times
too fully and confusedly, at others so concretely and glowingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
that Eva began to suspect something of the good fortune of
the coincidence that had brought her to his attention.</p>

<p>Finally came a day on which he spoke to her openly: “Do
you believe that you were born to be a dancer?” “I do believe
it,” she answered. Then he spoke to her concerning the
dance, and her wavering feeling grew firmer. Gradually she
felt her body growing lighter and lighter. When they parted
on that day, ambition was beginning to flame in her eyes.</p>

<p>He had taught her to stand with outstretched arms and to
let no muscle quiver; to stand on the tips of her toes so that
her crown touched a sharp arrow; to dance definite figures outlined
by needles on the floor with her naked feet, and, when
each movement had passed into her very flesh, to brave the
needles blindfolded. He taught her to whirl about a taut
rope adjusted vertically, and to walk on high stilts without
using her arms.</p>

<p>She had had to forget how she had walked hitherto, how she
had stridden and run and stood, and she had to learn anew
how to walk and stride and run and stand. Everything, as he
said, had to become new. Her limbs and ankles and wrists
had to adjust themselves to new functions, even as a man who
has lain in the mire of the street puts on new garments. “To
dance,” he would say, “means to be new, to be fresh at every
moment, as though one had just issued from the hand of God.”</p>

<p>He inducted her into the meaning and law of every movement,
into the inner structure and outer rhythm of every
gesture.</p>

<p>He created gestures with her. And about every gesture he
wove some experience. He showed her the nature of flight, of
pursuit, of parting, of salutation, of expectancy and triumph
and joy and terror; and there was no motion of a finger in
which the whole body did not have a part. The play of the
eyes and of facial expression entered this art so little that the
swathing of the face would not have diminished the effect that
was aimed at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew the kernel from each husk; he demanded the quintessential
only.</p>

<p>“Can you drink? Let me see you!” It was wrong.
“Your gesture was a shopworn phrase. The man who had
never seen another drink did not drink thus.”</p>

<p>“Can you pray? Can you pluck flowers, swing a scythe,
gather grain, bind a veil? Give me an image of each action!
Represent it!” She could not. But he taught her.</p>

<p>Whenever she fell into a flat imitation of reality he foamed
with rage. “Reality is a beast!” he roared, and hurled one
of his crutches against the wall. “Reality is a murderer.”</p>

<p>In the statues and paintings of great artists he pointed out
to her the essential and noble lines, and illustrated how all that
had been thus created and built merged harmoniously again
with nature and her immediacy of truth.</p>

<p>He spoke of the help of music to her art. “You need no
melody and scarcely tone. The only thing that matters is the
division of time, the audibly created measure which leads and
restrains the violence, wildness, and passion, or else the softness
and sustained beauty of motion. A tambourine and a fife
suffice. Everything beyond that is dishonesty and confusion.
Beware of a poetry of effect that does not issue from your
naked achievement.”</p>

<p>At night he took her to wine rooms and taverns, where the
girls of the people danced their artless and excited dances. He
revealed to her the artistic kernel of each, and let her dance a
bolero, a fandango, or a tarantella, which in this new embodiment
had the effect of cut and polished jewels.</p>

<p>He reconstructed antique battle-dances for her, the Pyrrhic
and the Karpaian; the dance of the Muses about the altar of
Zeus on Helicon; the dance of Artemis and her companions;
the dance of Delos, which imitated the path of Theseus through
the labyrinth; the dance of the maidens in honour of Artemis,
during which they wore a short chiton and a structure of
willow on their heads; the vintners’ dance preserved on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
cup of Hiero, which includes all the motions used by the
gatherers of the vine and the workers at the winepress. He
showed her pictures of the vase of François, of the geometrical
vase of Dipylon, of many reliefs and terracotta pieces, and
made her study the figures that had an entrancing charm and
incomparable rhythm of motion. And he procured her music
for these dances, which Susan copied from old manuscripts,
and which he adapted.</p>

<p>And from these creative exercises he led her on to a higher
freedom. He now stimulated her to invent for herself, to feel
with originality and give that feeling a creative form. He
vivified her glance, that was so often in thrall to the technical
or merely beautiful, liberated her senses, and gave her a clear
vision of that deaf, blind swarm and throng whom her art
would have to affect. He inspired her with love for the
immortal works of man, armoured her heart against seduction
by the vulgar, against a game but for the loftiest stakes, against
action without restraint, being without poise.</p>

<p>But it was not until she left him that she understood him
wholly.</p>

<p>When he thought her ripe for the glances of the world he
gave her recommendations to smooth the way, and also Susan.
He was willing to be a solitary. Susan had trained a young
Castilian to give him the care he needed. He did not say
whether he intended to stay in Toledo or choose some other
place. Since they had left him, neither Eva nor Susan had
heard from him: he had forbidden both letters and messages.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Often in the night Susan would sit in some dark corner, and
out of her deep brooding name her brother’s name. Her
thoughts turned about a reunion with him. Her service to
Eva was but a violent interruption of the accustomed life at
his side.</p>

<p>She loved Eva, but she loved her as Lucas Anselmo’s work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and projection. If Eva gained fame it was for him, if she
gathered treasure it was for him, if she grew in power it was
for him. Those who approached Eva and felt her sway were
his creatures, his serfs, and his messengers.</p>

<p>After the incident with Christian Wahnschaffe, as Susan
crouched at Eva’s feet and, as so often, embraced the girl’s
knees, she thought: Ah, he has breathed into her an irresistible
soul, and made her beautiful and radiant.</p>

<p>But always she harboured a superstitious fear. She trembled
in secret lest the irresistible soul should some day flee from
Eva’s body, and the radiance of her beauty be dulled, and
nothing remain but a dead and empty husk. For that would
be a sign to her that Lucas Anselmo was no more.</p>

<p>For this reason it delighted her when ecstasy and glee, glow
and tumult reigned in Eva’s life, and she was cast down and
plagued by evil presentiments when the girl withdrew into
quietness and remained silent and alone. So long as Eva
danced and loved and was mobile and adorned her body,
Susan dismissed all care concerning her brother. Therefore
she would sit and fan the flame from which his spirit seemed to
speak to her.</p>

<p>“Just because you’ve chosen the Englishman, you needn’t
send the German away,” she said. “You may take the one
and let the other languish a while longer. You can never tell
how things will change. There are many men: they rise and
fall. Cardillac is going down-hill now. I hear all kinds of
rumours.”</p>

<p>Eva, hiding her face in her hands, whispered: “Eidolon.”</p>

<p>It vexed Susan. “First you mock him, then you sigh for
him! What folly is this?”</p>

<p>Eva sprang up suddenly. “You shan’t speak of him to me
or praise him, wretched woman.” Her cheeks glowed, and the
brightly mocking tone in which she often spoke to Susan
became menacing.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Golpes para besos</i>,” Susan murmured in Spanish. “Blows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
for kisses.” She arose in order to comb Eva’s hair and braid
it for the night.</p>

<p>The next day Crammon appeared. “I found you one whose
laughter puts to shame the laughter of the muleteer of Cordova,”
he said with mock solemnity. “Why is he rejected?”</p>

<p>His heart bled. Yet he wooed her for his friend. Much as
he loved and admired Denis Lay, yet Christian was closer to
him. Christian was his discovery, of which he was vain, and
his hero.</p>

<p>Eva looked at him with eyes that glittered, and replied:
“It is true that he knows how to laugh like that muleteer of
Cordova, but he has no more culture of the heart than that
same fellow. And that, my dear man, is not enough.”</p>

<p>“And what is to become of us?” sighed Crammon.</p>

<p>“You may follow us to England,” Eva said cheerfully.
“I’m going to dance at His Majesty’s Theatre. Eidolon can
be my page. He can learn to practise reverence, and not to
chaffer for horses when beautiful poems are being read to me.
Tell him that.”</p>

<p>Crammon sighed again. Then he took her hand, and devoutly
kissed the tips of her fingers. “I shall deliver your
message, sweet Ariel,” he said.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Cardillac and Eva fell out, and that robbed the man of
his last support. The danger with which he was so rashly
playing ensnared him; the abysses lured him on.</p>

<p>The external impetus to his downfall was furnished by a
young engineer who had invented a hydraulic device. Cardillac
had persuaded him with magnificent promises to let him
engage in the practical exploitation of the invention. It was
not long before the engineer discovered that he had been
cheated of the profits of his labour. Quietly he accumulated
evidence against the speculator, unveiled his dishonest dealings,
and presented to the courts a series of annihilating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
charges. Although Cardillac finally offered him five hundred
thousand francs if he would withdraw his charges, the outraged
accuser remained firm.</p>

<p>Other untoward circumstances occurred. The catastrophe
became inevitable. On a single forenoon the shares he had
issued dropped to almost nothing. In forty-eight hours three
hundred millions of francs had been lost. Innumerable well-established
fortunes plunged like avalanches into nothingness,
eighteen hundred mechanics and shop-keepers lost all they had
in the world, twenty-seven great firms went into bankruptcy,
senators and deputies of the Republic were sucked down in the
whirlpool, and under the attacks of the opposition the very
administration shook.</p>

<p>Felix Imhof hurried to Paris to save whatever was possible
out of the crash. Although he had suffered painful losses, he
was ecstatic over the grandiose spectacle which Cardillac’s
downfall presented to the world.</p>

<p>Crammon laughed and rubbed his hands in satisfaction, and
pointed to Imhof. “He wanted to seduce me, but I was as
chaste as Joseph.”</p>

<p>On the following evening Imhof went with his friends to
visit Eva Sorel. She had left the palace which Cardillac had
furnished for her, and had rented a handsome house in the
Chaussée d’Antin.</p>

<p>Imhof spoke of the curious tragedy of these modern careers.
As an example he related how three days before his collapse
Cardillac had appeared at the headquarters of his bitterest
enemies, the Bank of Paris. The directors were having a
meeting. None was absent. With folded hands and tear-stained
face the sorely beset man begged for a loan of twelve
millions. It was a drastic symptom of his naïveté that he asked
help of those whom he had fleeced on the exchange year in
and year out, whose losses had glutted his wealth, and whom he
wanted to fight with the very loan for which he begged.</p>

<p>Christian scarcely listened. He stood with Crammon beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a Chinese screen. Opposite them sat Eva in a curiously dreamy
mood, and not far from her was Denis Lay. Others were
present too, but Christian gave them no attention.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a commotion near the door. “Cardillac,”
some one whispered. All glances sought him.</p>

<p>It was indeed Cardillac who had entered. His boots were
muddy, his collar and cravat in disorder. He seemed not to
have changed his garments for a week. His fists were clenched;
his restless eyes wandered from face to face.</p>

<p>Eva and Denis remained calmly as they were. Eva pressed
her foot against the edge of a copper jar filled with white
lilies. No one moved. Only Christian, quite involuntarily,
approached Cardillac by a few paces.</p>

<p>Cardillac became aware of him, and drew him by the sleeve
toward the door of the adjoining room. They had scarcely
crossed the threshold when Cardillac whispered in an intense
but subdued tone: “I must have two thousand francs or
I’m done for! Advance me that much, monsieur, and save
me. I have a wife and a child.”</p>

<p>Christian was astonished. No one dreamed that the man
had a family. And why turn precisely to him? Wiguniewski,
d’Autichamps, many others knew him far better.</p>

<p>“I must be at the station in half an hour,” he heard the
man say, and his hand sought his purse.</p>

<p>Wife and child! The words flitted through his head, and
there arose in him the violent aversion he always felt in the
presence of beggars. What had he to do with it all? He took
out the bank notes. Two thousand francs, he thought, and
remembered the huge sums which one was accustomed to name
in connection with the man who stood before him begging.</p>

<p>“I thank you.” Cardillac’s voice came to him as through
a wall.</p>

<p>Then Cardillac passed him with bent head. But two men
had in the meantime appeared in the other room. At the
open folding-door the lackeys stood behind them with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
embarrassed expression, for the men were police officials who
were seeking Cardillac and had followed him here.</p>

<p>Cardillac, seeing them and guessing their errand, recoiled
with a gurgling noise in his throat. His right hand disappeared
in his coat-pocket, but instantly the two men leaped on him
and pinioned his arms. There was a brief, silent struggle.
Suddenly he was made fast.</p>

<p>Eva had arisen. Her guests crowded about her. She leaned
against Susan’s shoulder and turned her head a little aside,
as though a touch of uncanny terror brushed her. But she
still smiled, though now with pallid cheeks.</p>

<p>“He’s magnificent, magnificent, even at this moment,”
Imhof whispered to Crammon.</p>

<p>Christian stared at Cardillac’s huge back. It was, he
couldn’t help thinking, like the back of an ox dragged to
slaughter. The two men between whom he stood hand-cuffed
had greasy necks, and the hair on the back of their heads was
dirty and ill-trimmed.</p>

<p>An unpleasant taste on his palate tormented Christian. He
asked a servant for a glass of champagne.</p>

<p>Cardillac’s words, “I have a wife and a child,” would not
leave his mind. On the contrary, they sounded ever more
stridently within him. And suddenly a second, foolish, curious
voice in him asked: How do you suppose they look&mdash;this wife,
this child? Where are they? What will become of them?</p>

<p>It was as annoying and as painful as a toothache.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>In Devon, south of Exeter, Denis Lay had his country seat.
The manor stood in a park of immemorial trees, velvety swards,
small lakes that mirrored the sky, and flowerbeds beautiful in
the mildest climate of such a latitude on earth.</p>

<p>“We’re quite near the Gulf Stream here,” Crammon explained
to Christian and Eva, who, like himself, were Lay’s
guests. And he had an expression as though with his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
hands he had brought the warm current to the English coast
from the Gulf of Mexico simply for the benefit of his friends.</p>

<p>With a gesture of sisterly tenderness Eva walked for hours
among the beds of blossoming violets. Large surfaces were
mildly and radiantly blue. It was March.</p>

<p>A company of English friends was expected, but not until
two days later.</p>

<p>The four friends, going for a walk, had been overtaken by
showers and came home drenched. When they had changed
their clothes, they met for tea in the library. It was a great
room with wainscoting of dark oak and mighty cross-beams.
Halfway up there ran along the walls a gallery with carved
balustrades, and at one end, between the pointed windows,
appeared the gilded pipes of an organ.</p>

<p>The light was dim and the rain swished without. Eva held
an album of Holbein drawings, and turned the pages slowly.
Christian and Crammon were playing at chess. Denis watched
them for a while. Then he sat down at the organ and began
to play.</p>

<p>Eva looked up from the pictures and listened.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost the game,” Christian said. He arose and mounted
the steps to the gallery. He leaned over the balustrade and
looked down. In an outward curve of the balustrade there
lay, like an egg in its cup, a globe on a metal stand.</p>

<p>“What were you playing?” Eva asked, as Denis paused.</p>

<p>He turned around. “I’ve been trying to compose a passage
from the Song of Songs,” he answered. He played again and
sang in an agreeable voice: “Arise, thou lovely one, for the
winter is past.”</p>

<p>The sound of the organ stirred a feeling of hatred in
Christian. He gazed upon Eva’s form. In a gown of sea-green,
slim, far, estranged, she sat there. And as he looked
at her there blended with his hatred of the music another
feeling&mdash;one of oppression and of poignant pain, and his
heart began to throb violently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Arise, thou lovely one, and come with me,” Denis sang
again, and Crammon softly hummed the air too. Eva looked
up, and her glance met Christian’s. In her face there was a
mysterious expression of loftiness and love.</p>

<p>Christian took the globe from its stand and played with
it. He let it roll back and forth between his hands on the
flat balustrade like a rubber ball. The sphere suddenly slipped
from him, fell and rolled along the floor to Eva’s feet.</p>

<p>Denis and Crammon gathered about it; Christian came down
from the gallery.</p>

<p>Eva picked up the globe and went toward Christian. He
took it from her, but she at once held out her hands again.
Then she held it daintily poised upon the fingertips of her
right hand. Her left hand, with fingers spread out, she held
close to it; her head was gently inclined, her lips half open.</p>

<p>“So this is the world,” she said, “your world! The blue
bits are the seas, and that soiled yellow the countries. How
ugly the countries are, and how jagged! They look like a
cheese at which mice have nibbled. O world, the things that
creep about on you! The things that happen on you! I hold
you now, world, and carry you! I like that!”</p>

<p>The three men smiled, but a psychical shudder passed
through them. For they could no longer stand in human
erectness on this little round earth. A breath of the dancer
could blow them down into the immeasurable depths of the
cosmos.</p>

<p>And Christian saw that Denis, fighting with an impulse,
regarded him. Suddenly the Englishman came up to him and
held out his hand. And Christian took the hand of his victorious
rival, and knew in his secretest mind that an ultimate
advantage was his. For between Eva’s face and the smudged
globe he seemed to see a ghostly little figure which charmed her
with its glance and which was a tiny image of himself&mdash;Eidolon.</p>

<p>They planned that summer to return to the manor and hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the deer, as was the custom of the gentlemen of that region.
But when summer came all things had changed, and Denis
had glided from the smooth sphere of earth into the depth.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>One day in London Crammon came to Christian, sat down
affectionately beside him, and said: “I am leaving.”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” Christian asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“North, to fish salmon,” Crammon replied. “I’ll join you
later or you can join me.”</p>

<p>“But why go at all?”</p>

<p>“Because I’ll go straight to the dogs if I have to see this
woman any longer without possessing her. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Christian looked at Crammon with a flame in his eyes, and
checked a gesture of angry jealousy. Then his face assumed
its expression of friendly mockery again.</p>

<p>So Crammon departed.</p>

<p>Eva Sorel became the undisputed queen of the London
season. Her name was everywhere. The women wore hats à la
Eva Sorel, the men cravats in her favourite colours. She
threw into the shade the most sought-after celebrities of the
day&mdash;including the Negro bruiser, Jackson. Fame came to her
in full draughts, and gold by the pailfuls.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>May was very hot in London that year. Denis and Christian
planned a night’s pleasure on the Thames. They rented a
steam yacht named “Aldebaran,” ordered an exquisite meal on
board, and Denis sent out invitations to his friends.</p>

<p>Fourteen members of his set joined the party. The yacht
lay near the houses of Parliament, and shortly before midnight
the guests appeared in evening dress. The son of the
Russian ambassador was among them, the Honourable James
Wheely, whose brother was in the ministry, Lord and Lady
Westmoreland, Eva Sorel, Prince Wiguniewski, and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>On the stroke of twelve the “Aldebaran” started out, and
the small orchestra of well-chosen artists began to play.</p>

<p>When the yacht on its way upstream had reached the railway
bridge of Battersea, there became visible on the left bank
in the dim light of the street lamps an innumerable throng
of men and women, close-packed, head by head, thousands
upon thousands.</p>

<p>They were strikers from the docks. Why they stood here,
so silent and so menacing in their silence, was known to no one
on board. Perhaps it was a demonstration of some sort.</p>

<p>Denis, who had had a good deal of champagne, went to the
railing, and in his recklessness shouted three cheers across the
river. No sound answered him. The human mass stood like
a wall, and in the sombre faces that turned toward the gleam
of the yacht’s light no muscle moved.</p>

<p>Then Denis said to Christian, who had joined him: “Let’s
swim across. Whoever reaches shore first is victor of the
race, and must ask those people what they are waiting for and
why they don’t go home at this hour of the night.”</p>

<p>“Swim over to <i>them</i>?” Christian shook his head. He was
asked to touch slimy worms with his hands and pretend they
were trophies.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll do it alone!” Denis exclaimed, and threw his
coat and waistcoat down on the deck.</p>

<p>He was known to be an admirable swimmer. The company
therefore took his notion as one of the bizarre pranks
for which he was known. Only Eva tried to restrain him.
She approached him and laid her hand on his arm. In vain.
He was quite ready to jump, when the captain grasped his
shoulder and begged him to desist, since the river, despite its
calm appearance, had a strong undercurrent. But Denis eluded
him, ran to the promenade deck, and in another moment his
slender body flew into the black water.</p>

<p>No one had a presentiment of disaster. The swimmer
advanced with powerful strokes. The watchers on board were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sure that he would easily reach the Chelsea shore. But suddenly,
in the bright radiance of a searchlight from shore,
they saw him throw up his arms above his head. At the same
moment he cried piercingly for help. Without hesitation a
member of the little orchestra, a cellist, sprang overboard in
all his garments to help the drowning man. But the current
caused by the ebbtide was very powerful, and both Denis and
the musician were whirled onward by it, and disappeared in
the inky waves.</p>

<p>Suddenly the confusion caused by these happenings lifted
from Christian’s mind, and before any could restrain him, he
was in the water. He heard a cry, and knew that it came from
Eva’s lips. The ladies and gentlemen on board scurried helplessly
to and fro.</p>

<p>Christian could no longer make out the forms of the other
two. The water seemed to bank itself against him and hinder
his movements. A sudden weakness took possession of him,
but he felt no fear. Raising his head he saw the silent masses
of the workers, men and women with such expressions as he
had never seen. Although the glance which he directed toward
them was but a momentary one, he felt almost sure that their
sombre earnestness of gaze was fixed on him, and that these
thousands and thousands were waiting for him, and for him
alone. His weakness increased. It seemed to arise from
his heart, which grew heavier and heavier. At that moment
a life-boat reached him.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the morning, in the earliest dawn, the
bodies of Denis and the musician were found jammed between
two beams near the arches of a bridge. Now they lay on
deck and Christian could contemplate them. The guests had
left the ship. Eva, too, had gone. She had been deeply
shaken, and Prince Wiguniewski had accompanied her home.</p>

<p>The sailors had gone to their bunks. The deck was empty,
and Christian sat alone with the two dead men.</p>

<p>The sun arose. The waters of the river began to glow. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
pavements of the desolate streets, the walls and the windows
of the houses flushed with the red of dawn. Sea-gulls circled
about the smokestack.</p>

<p>Christian sat alone with the dead men. He was huddled in
an old coat which the captain had thrown around his shoulders.
Steadily he gazed upon the faces of the dead. They were
swollen and ugly.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>North of Loch Lomond, Christian and Crammon wandered
about shooting snipes and wild ducks. The land was rough
and wild; always within their hearing thundered the sea;
storm-harried masses of cloud raced across the sky.</p>

<p>“My father will be far from pleased,” said Christian. “I’ve
spent two hundred and eighty thousand marks in the last ten
months.”</p>

<p>“Your mother will persuade him to bear it,” Crammon
answered. “Anyhow, you’re of age. You can use several
times that much without any one hindering you.”</p>

<p>Christian threw back his head, and drew the salty air deep
into his lungs. “I wonder what little Letitia is doing,” he
said.</p>

<p>“I think of the child myself at times. She shouldn’t be
left entirely to that old schemer,” Crammon replied.</p>

<p>Her kiss no longer burned on Christian’s lips, for other
flames had touched them since. Like laughing <i>putti</i> in a painting,
the lovely faces fluttered about him. Many of them, to
be sure, were laughing now no more.</p>

<p>In a dark gown, emerging from between two white columns,
Eva had taken leave of him. He seemed to see her still&mdash;the
brunette pallor of her face, her inexpressibly slender hand, the
most eloquent hand in the world.</p>

<p>Jestingly and familiarly she had spoken to him in the
language of her German homeland, which seemed more piercingly
sweet and melodious in her mouth than in any other’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where are you going, Eidolon?” she had asked carelessly.</p>

<p>He had answered with a gesture of uncertainty. He evidently
thought that his going or coming was indifferent to her.</p>

<p>“It isn’t nice of you to go without asking leave,” she said,
and put her hands on his shoulders. “But perhaps it is just
as well. You confuse me. I am beginning to think of you,
and I don’t want to do that.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t. Why do you need reasons?”</p>

<p>The dead and swollen face of Denis Lay rose up before them,
and they both saw it in the empty air.</p>

<p>After a little he had dared to ask: “When shall we meet
again?”</p>

<p>“It depends on you,” she had answered. “Always let me
know where you are, so that I can send for you. Of course,
it’s nonsense, and I won’t. But it might just happen that in
some whim I may want you and none other. Only you must
learn&mdash;&mdash;” She stopped and smiled.</p>

<p>“What, what must I learn?”</p>

<p>“Ask your friend Crammon. He’ll teach you.” After these
words she had left him.</p>

<p>The sea roared like a herd of steers. Christian stopped and
turned to Crammon. “Listen, Bernard, there’s a matter that
comes back curiously into my mind. When I last talked to
Eva she said there was something I was to learn before I
could see her again. And when I asked after her meaning,
she said that you could give me a hint. What is it? What
am I to learn?”</p>

<p>Crammon answered seriously: “You see, my boy, these
things are rather complicated. Some people like their steak
overdone, others almost raw, most people medium. Well, if
you don’t know a certain person’s taste and serve the steak
the way you yourself prefer it, you risk making a blunder
and looking like a fool. People are far from simple.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Bernard.”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t matter a bit, old chap! Don’t bother your handsome
head about it. Let’s go on. This damned country makes
me melancholy.”</p>

<p>They went on. But there was an unknown sadness in
Christian’s heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">AN OWL ON EVERY POST</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Letitia</span> felt vague longings.</p>

<p>She accompanied her aunt, the countess, to the south of
Switzerland, and loitered in wonder at the foot of blue glaciers;
she lay on the shore of Lake Geneva, dreaming or reading
poetry. When she appeared smiling on the promenade, admiring
glances were all about her. Enthusiastically conscious
of her youth and of her emotional wealth, she enjoyed the
day and the evening as each came, pictures and books, fragrances
and tones. But her longings did not cease.</p>

<p>Many came and spoke to her of love&mdash;some frankly and
some by implication. And she too was full of love&mdash;not for
him who spoke, but for his words, expressions, presages. If
a delighted glance met hers, it delighted her. And she lent her
ear with equal patience to wooers of twenty or of sixty.</p>

<p>But her yearnings were not assuaged.</p>

<p>Her aunt, the countess, said: “Have nothing to do with
aristocrats, my dear. They are uncultivated and full of false
pride. They don’t know the difference between a woman
and a horse. They would nail your young heart to a family
tree, and if you don’t appreciate that favour sufficiently, they
stamp you as déclassée for life. If they have no money they
are too stupid to earn any; if they have it they don’t know
how to spend it sensibly. Have no dealings with them.
They’re not quite human.”</p>

<p>The countess’ experiences with the aristocracy had been
very bitter. “You can imagine, my dear,” she said, “that I
was hard pressed in my time to be forced to say these things
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Letitia sat on the edge of her bed and regarded her silk
stocking, which had a little hole in it, and still felt the same
longing.</p>

<p>Judith wrote her: “We expect you and the countess so soon
as we are settled in our new house near Frankfort. It’s a kind
of fairy palace that papa has built us, and it’s to be the family
seat hereafter. It’s situated in the forest of Schwanheim, and
is only ten minutes by motor from the city. Everybody who
has seen it is mad about it. Felix Imhof says it reminds him of
the palace of the Minotaur. There are thirty-four guest-rooms,
a gallery fifty metres long with niches and columns,
and a library that’s been modelled after the cupola of St.
Peter’s at Rome. There are twenty thousand perfectly new
books in it. Who’s to read them all?”</p>

<p>“I love the thought of them,” said Letitia, and pressed her
hand against her heart.</p>

<p>She had had a golden charm made in the likeness of a tiny
toad. She did not wear it about her neck, but kept it in a
little leathern case, from which she often took it, and brooded
over it lovingly.</p>

<p>In Schwetzingen she had met a young Argentinian of German
descent. He was studying law at Heidelberg, but he
confessed to her frankly that he had come to Europe to get
him a German wife. He gave her this information at noon.
At night he gave her to understand that in her he had met his
goal.</p>

<p>His name was Stephen Gunderam. His skin was olive,
his eyes glowing, his hair coal black and parted in the middle.
Letitia was fascinated by his person, the countess by the
rumours of his wealth. She made inquiries, and discovered
that the rumours had not been exaggerated. The lands of
the Gunderams on the Rio Plata were more extensive than the
Duchy of Baden.</p>

<p>“Now, sweetheart, there’s a husband for you!” said the
countess. But when she considered that she would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
part with Letitia, she began to cry, and lost her appetite for a
whole forenoon.</p>

<p>Stephen Gunderam told them about his far, strange country,
about his parents, brothers, servants, herds, houses. He
declared that the bride he brought home would be a queen.
He was so strong that he could bend a horse-shoe. But he
was afraid of spiders, believed in evil omens, and suffered
from frequent headaches. At such times he would lie in
bed, and drink warm beer mixed with milk and the yolk of
eggs. This was a remedy which an old mulatto woman had
once given him.</p>

<p>Letitia barely listened. She was reading:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“And have you seen an inmost dream</div>
       <div class="verse">Fled from you and denied?</div>
       <div class="verse">Then gaze into the flowing stream,</div>
       <div class="verse">Where all things change and glide.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“You really must hurry, darling,” the countess admonished
her again.</p>

<p>But Letitia was so full of longing.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>In a city on the Rhine, Christian and Crammon were delayed
by an accident. Something had happened to the motor of
their car, and the chauffeur needed a whole day for repairs.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful evening of September, so they left the
city streets and wandered quietly along the bank of the river.
When darkness fell, they drifted by chance into a beer-garden
near the water. The tables and benches, rammed firmly into
the earth, stood among trees full of foliage, and were occupied
by several hundred people&mdash;tradesmen, workingmen, and
students.</p>

<p>“Let us rest a while and watch the people,” said Crammon.
And near the entrance they found a table with two vacant
seats. A bar-maid placed two pitchers of beer before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the trees the air had something subterranean about
it, for it was filled with the odour of the exudations of
so many people. The few lamps had iridescent rings of smoke
about them. At the adjoining table sat students with their
red caps and other fraternity insignia. They had fat, puffed-out
faces and insolent voices. One of them hit the table three
times with his stick. Then they began to sing.</p>

<p>Crammon opened his eyes very wide, and his lips twitched
mockingly. He said: “That’s my notion of the way wild
Indians act&mdash;Sioux or Iroquois.” Christian did not answer.
He kept his arms quite close to his body, and his shoulders
drawn up a little. There was a good deal of noise at all the
tables, and, after a while, Christian said: “Do let us go. I’m
not comfortable here.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but my dear boy, this is the great common people!”
Crammon instructed him with a mixture of arrogance and
mockery. “Thus do they sing and drink and&mdash;smell. ‘And
calmly flows the Rhine.’ Your health, your Highness!” He
always called Christian that among strangers, and was delighted
when those who overheard showed a respectful curiosity. As
a matter of fact, several of the men at their table looked at
them in some consternation, and then whispered among themselves.</p>

<p>A young girl with blond braids of hair wreathed about her
head had entered the garden. She stopped near the entrance,
and looked searchingly from table to table. The students
laughed, and one called out to her. She hesitated shyly. Yet
she went up to him. “Whom are you looking for, pretty
maiden?” a freshman asked. The girl did not answer. “Hide
in the pitcher for your forwardness,” a senior cried. “It
is for me to ask.” The freshman grinned, and took a long
draught of beer. “What do you desire, little maiden?” the
senior asked in a beery voice. “Have you come to fetch your
father, who clings too lovingly to his jug?” The girl blushed
and nodded. She was asked to give her name, and said it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was Katherine Zöllner. Her father, she said, was a boatman.
She spoke softly, yet so that Christian and Crammon understood
what she said. Her father was due to join his ship
for Cologne at three o’clock in the morning. “For Cologne,”
the senior growled. “Give me a kiss, and I’ll find your
father for you.”</p>

<p>The girl trembled and recoiled. But the fraternity approved
of the demand, and roared applause. “Don’t pretend!” the
senior said. He got up, put his arms roughly about her waist,
and, despite her resistance and fright, he kissed her.</p>

<p>“Me, too! Me, too!” The cries arose from the others.
The girl had already been passed on to a second, a third
snatched her, then a fourth, fifth, sixth. She could not cry
out. She could scarcely breathe. Her resistance grew feebler,
the roaring and the laughter louder. The fellows at the neighbouring
table grew envious. A fat man with warts on his
face called out: “Now you come to us!” His comrades
brayed with laughter. When the last student let her go, it
was this man who grasped her, kissed her and threw her toward
his neighbour. More and more men arose, stretched out their
arms, and demanded the defenceless victim. Nothing happened
except that they kissed her. Yet there spread through
the crowd a wildness of lust, so that even the women screeched
and cried out. The students, in the meantime, proud of their
little game, raised their rough voices and sang a foolish song.</p>

<p>The body of the girl, now an unresisting and almost lifeless
thing, was whirled from arm to arm. Christian and Crammon
had arisen. They gazed into the quivering throng under
the trees, heard the shrieks, the cries, the laughter, saw the
girl, now far away, and the hands stretched out after her, and
her face with eyes that were now closed, now open again in
horror. At last one was found who had compassion. He was
a young workingman, and he hit the man who was just kissing
the girl square between the eyes. Two others then attacked
him, and there ensued a rough fight, while the girl with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
little remaining strength reeled toward the fence where the
ground was grassy. Her hair fell loose, her blue bodice was
torn and showed her naked bosom, her face was covered with
ugly bruises. She tried to keep erect, groped about, but fell.
A few thoughtful people now came up, helped her, and asked
each other what was to be done.</p>

<p>Christian and Crammon followed the shore of the river back
to the city. The students had begun a new ditty, that sounded
discordantly through the night, until the distance gradually
silenced it.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>In the middle of the night Christian left his couch, slipped
into a silk dressing gown and entered Crammon’s room. He lit
a candle, sat down by the side of Crammon’s bed, and shook
his sleeping friend by the shoulder. Crammon battled with
sleep itself, and Christian turned his head away in order not
to see the struggling, primitive face.</p>

<p>At last, after much grunting and groaning, Crammon opened
his eyes. “What do you want?” he asked angrily. “Are you
practising to play a ghost?”</p>

<p>“I would like to ask you something, Bernard,” Christian
said.</p>

<p>This enraged Crammon all the more. “It is crazy to rob
a man of his well-deserved rest. Are you moonstruck, or have
you a bellyache? Ask what you want to ask, but hurry!”</p>

<p>“Do you believe I do right to live as I do?” asked Christian.
“Be quite honest for once, and answer me.”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt that he’s moonstruck!” Crammon was
truly horrified. “His mind is wandering. We must summon
a physician.” He half-rose, and fumbled for the electric
button.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that!” Christian restrained him mildly, and
smiled a vexed smile. “Try to consider what I’ve said. Rub
your eyes if you aren’t quite awake yet. There’s time enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
for sleep. But I am asking you, Bernard, for your quite sincere
opinion: Do you think I am right in living as I do?”</p>

<p>“My dear Christian Wahnschaffe, if you can tell me by
what process this craze has&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t jest, Bernard,” Christian interrupted him, frowning.
“This is no time for a jest. Do you think that I should
have remained with Eva?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Crammon. “She would have betrayed
you; she would have betrayed me. She would betray the
emperor, and yet stand guiltless in the sight of God. You
can’t reckon with her, you can’t really be yourself with her.
She was fashioned for the eye alone. Even that little story
of the muleteer of Cordova was a trick. Be content, and let
me sleep.”</p>

<p>Christian replied thoughtfully. “I don’t understand what
you say, and you don’t understand what I mean. Since I left
her I feel sometimes as though I had grown hunchbacked.
Jesting aside, Bernard, I get up sometimes and a terror comes
over me. I stretch myself out. I know that I’m straight,
and yet I feel as though I were hunchbacked.”</p>

<p>“Completely out of his head,” Crammon murmured.</p>

<p>“And now tell me another thing, Bernard,” Christian continued,
undeflected by his friend, and his clear, open face
assumed an icy expression. “Should we not have helped the
boatman’s daughter, you and I? Or should I not have done
so, if you did not care to take the trouble? Tell me that!”</p>

<p>“The devil take it! What boatman’s daughter?”</p>

<p>“Are you so forgetful? The girl in the beer-garden. She
even gave her name&mdash;Katherine Zöllner. Don’t you remember?
And how those ruffians treated her?”</p>

<p>“Was I to risk my skin for a boatman’s daughter?” Crammon
asked, enraged. “People of that sort may take their
pleasures in their own fashion. What is it to you or to me?
Did you try to hold back the paws of the wild beasts that
tore up Adda Castillo? And that was a good deal worse than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
being kissed by a hundred greasy snouts. Don’t be an idiot,
my dear fellow, and let me sleep!”</p>

<p>“I am curious,” said Christian.</p>

<p>“Curious? What about?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to the house where she lives and see how she
is. I want you to go along. Get up.”</p>

<p>Crammon opened his mouth very wide in his astonishment.
“Go now?” he stammered, “at night? Are you quite
crazy?”</p>

<p>“I knew you’d scold,” Christian said softly and with a
dreamy smile. “But that curiosity torments me so that I’ve
simply been turning from side to side in bed.” And in truth
his face had an expression of expectation and of subtle desire
that was new to Crammon. He went on: “I want to see what
she is doing, what her life is like, what her room looks like.
One should know about all that. We are hopelessly ignorant
about people of that kind. Do please come on, Bernard.”
His tone was almost cajoling.</p>

<p>Crammon sighed. He waxed indignant. He protested the
frailty of his health and the necessity of sleep for his wearied
mind. Since Christian, however, opposed to all these objections
an insensitive silence, and since Crammon did not want
to see him visit a dangerous and disreputable quarter of the
city alone by night, he finally submitted, and, grumbling still,
arose from his bed.</p>

<p>Christian bathed and dressed with his accustomed care.
Before leaving the hotel they consulted a directory, and found
the address of the boatman. They hired a cab. It was half-past
four in the morning when their cab reached the hut beside
the river bank. There was light in the windows.</p>

<p>Crammon was still at a loss to comprehend. With the rusty
bell-pull in his hand, his confused and questioning eyes sought
Christian once more. But the latter paid no attention to his
friend. A care-worn, under-nourished woman appeared at the
door. Crammon was forced to speak, and, with inner vexa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>tion,
said that they had come to ask after her daughter. The
woman, who immediately imagined that her daughter had had
secret affairs with rich gentlemen, stepped aside and let the two
pass her.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>What Crammon saw and what Christian saw was not the
same thing.</p>

<p>Crammon saw a dimly lit room, with old chests of drawers
that were smoke-stained, with a bed and the girl Katherine on
it covered by the coarse, red-checked linen, with a cradle in
which lay a whining baby. He saw clothes drying by the
oven, the boatman sitting and eating potato soup, a bench on
which a lad was sleeping, and many other unclean, ugly things.</p>

<p>To Christian it was like a strange dream of falling. He,
too, saw the boatman and the poor woman and the girl, whose
glassy eyes and convulsed features brought home to him at
once the reason for his visit. But he saw these things as one
sees pictures while gliding down a shaft, pictures that recur
at intervals, but are displaced by others that slip in between
them.</p>

<p>Thus he saw Eva Sorel feeding a walnut to one of her little
monkeys.</p>

<p>The boatman got up and took off his cap. And suddenly
Christian saw Denis Lay and Lord Westmoreland giving each
other their white-gloved hands. It was an insignificant thing;
but his vision of it was glaring and incisive.</p>

<p>Now the lad on the bench awakened, stretched himself, sat
up with a start, and gave a sombre stare of astonishment at
the strangers. The girl, ill from her horrible experience, turned
her head away, and pulled the coverlet up to her chin. And
suddenly Christian saw the charming vision of Letitia, playing
at ball in the great room crossed by the gleams of lightning;
and each thing that he saw had a relation to some other
thing in that other world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The curiosity that had brought him hither still kept that
unwonted smile on his face. But he looked helplessly at
Crammon now, and he was sensitive to the indecency of his
silent, stupid presence there, the purposelessness and folly of
the whole nocturnal excursion. It seemed almost intolerable to
him now to stay longer in this low-ceiled room, amid the odour
of ill-washed bodies, and clothing that had been worn for years.</p>

<p>Up to the last moment he had imagined that he would talk
to the girl. But it was precisely this that he found it impossible
to do. He did not even dare to turn his head to where
she lay. Yet he was acutely conscious of her as he had seen
her out there, reeling from the tables with loose hair and torn
bodice.</p>

<p>When he thought over the words that he might say to her,
each seemed strikingly superfluous and vulgar.</p>

<p>The boatman looked at him, the woman looked at him.
The lad stared with malevolently squinting eyes, as though he
planned a personal attack. And now there emerged also an
old man from behind a partition where potatoes were stored,
and regarded him with dim glances. In the embarrassment
caused him by all these eyes, he advanced a few steps toward
Katherine’s bed. She had turned her face to the wall, and
did not move. In his sudden angry despair he put his hands
into pocket after pocket, found nothing, hardly knew indeed
what he sought, felt the diamond ring on his finger which was
a gift of his mother, hastily drew it off, and threw it on the
bed, into the very hands of the girl. It was the act of one who
desired to buy absolution.</p>

<p>Katherine moved her head, saw the magnificent ring, and
contempt and astonishment, delight and fear, struggled in her
face. She looked up, and then down again, and grew pale.
Her face was not beautiful, and it was disfigured by the emotions
she had experienced during the past hours. An impulse
that was utterly mysterious to himself caused Christian suddenly
to laugh cheerfully and heartily. At the same time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
turned with a commanding gesture to Crammon, demanding
that they go.</p>

<p>Crammon had meantime determined to ease the painfulness
of the situation in a practical way. He addressed a few
words to the boatman, who answered in the dialect of Cologne.
Then he drew forth two bank notes and laid them on the table.
The boatman looked at the money; the hands of the woman
were stretched out after it. Crammon walked to the door.</p>

<p>Five minutes after they had entered the house, they left it
again. And they left it swiftly, like men fleeing.</p>

<p>While the cab drove over the rough stones of the street,
Crammon said peevishly: “You owe your paymaster a hundred
marks. I won’t charge you for anything except the
money. You can’t, I suppose, give me back my lost sleep.”</p>

<p>“I shall give you for it the Chinese apple of amber-coloured
ivory about which you were so enthusiastic at Amsterdam,”
Christian replied.</p>

<p>“Do that, my son,” Crammon said, “and do it quickly, or
my rage over this whole business will make me ill.”</p>

<p>When he got up at noon thoroughly rested, Crammon reflected
on the incident with that philosophic mildness of which,
under the right circumstances, he was capable. After they had
had a delightful breakfast, he filled his short pipe, and discoursed:
“Such extravagances in the style of Haroun al
Rashid get you nowhere, my dear boy. You can’t fathom those
sombre depths. Why hunt in unknown lands, when the familiar
ones still have so many charms? Even your humble servant
who sits opposite you is still a very treasure of riddles and
mysteries. That is what a wise poet has strikingly expressed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“What know we of the stars, of water or of wind?</div>
       <div class="verse">What of the dead, to whom the earth is kind?</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Of father and mother, or of child and wife?</div>
       <div class="verse">Our hearts are hungry, but our eyes are blind.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Christian smiled coolly. Verses, he thought contemptuously,
verses....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>When they reached the magnificent structure in the forest
of Schwanheim, they found a great restlessness there and a
crowd of guests. Letitia had not yet arrived; Felix Imhof was
expected hourly; purveyors and postmen came and went uninterruptedly.
The place hummed like a hive.</p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe greeted Christian with restraint and dignity,
although her joy gave her eyes a phosphorescent gleam.
Judith looked exhausted, and paid little attention to her
brother. But one evening she suddenly rushed into his arms,
with a strange wild cry that betrayed the impatience and the
hidden desires that had so long preyed on the cold and
ambitious girl.</p>

<p>Christian felt the cry like a discord, and disengaged himself.</p>

<p>He and Crammon went hunting or took trips to the neighbouring
cities. Nothing held Christian anywhere. He wanted
always to go farther or elsewhere. His very eyes became
restless. When they walked through the streets, he glanced
surreptitiously into the windows of apartments and into the
halls of houses.</p>

<p>One night they sat in a wine cellar at Mainz, drinking a
vintage that was thirty years old and had a rare bouquet.
Crammon, who was a connoisseur through and through, kept
filling his glass with an enchanted air. “It’s sublime,” he
said, and began eating his caviare sandwich, “simply sublime.
These are the realities of life. Here are my altars, my books
of devotion, my relics, the scenes of my silent prayers. The
immortal soul is at rest, and the lofty and unapproachable
lies in the dust behind me.”</p>

<p>“Talk like a decent man,” said Christian.</p>

<p>But Crammon, who felt the ecstasy of wine, was not to be
deflected. “I have drunk the draught of earthly delight. I
have done it, O friend and brother, in huts and palaces, North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and South, on sea and land. Only the final fulfilment was
denied me. O Ariel, why did you cast me forth?”</p>

<p>He sighed, and drew from his inner pocket a tiny album
in a precious binding. He always had it with him, for it
contained twelve exquisite photographs of the dancer, Eva
Sorel. “She is like a boy,” he said, wholly absorbed in the
pictures, “a slender, swift, unapproachable boy. She stands
on the mystic boundary line of the sexes; she is that equivocal
and twofold thing that maddens men if they but think of flesh
and blood. Elusive she is as a lizard, and chill in love as an
Amazon. Do you not feel a touch of horror, Christian? Does
not a cold ichor trickle through your veins, when you imagine
her in your arms, breast to breast? I feel that horror! For
there would be something of the perverse in it&mdash;something
of an unnatural violation. He who has touched her lips is lost.
We saw that for ourselves.”</p>

<p>Christian suddenly felt a yearning to be alone in a forest,
in a dark and silent forest. He did feel a sense of horror, but
in a way utterly alien to Crammon’s thought. He looked
at the older man, and it was hard for him to comprehend
that there, opposite him, sat his familiar friend, whose face
and form he had seen a thousand times unreflectively.</p>

<p>Crammon, contemplating the photograph on which Eva
appeared dancing with a basket of grapes, began again:
“Sweetest Ariel, they are all harlots, all, all, all, whether
shameless and wild or fearful and secretive: you alone are
pure&mdash;a vestal, a half-ghost, a weaver of silk, like the spider,
who conquers the air upon her half-spun web. Let us drink,
O friend! We are made of dirt, and must be medicined by
fire!”</p>

<p>He drained his glass, rested his head upon his hand, and
sank into melancholy contemplation.</p>

<p>Suddenly Christian said: “Bernard, I believe that we must
part.”</p>

<p>Crammon stared at him, as though he had not heard right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe that we must part,” Christian repeated softly
and with an indistinct smile. “I fear that we are no longer
suited to each other. You must go your ways, and I shall go
mine.”</p>

<p>Crammon’s face became dark red with astonishment and
rage. He brought his fist down on the table and gritted his
teeth. “What do you mean? Do you think you can send me
packing as though I were a servant? Me?” He arose, took
his hat and coat, and went.</p>

<p>Christian sat there for long with his thoughts. The indistinct
smile remained on his lips.</p>

<p>When Christian, on awakening next day, rang for his valet,
Crammon entered the room in the man’s stead and made a
deep bow. Over his left arm he had Christian’s garments,
in his right hand his boots. He said good-morning quite in
the valet’s tone, laid the clothes on a chair, set the boots on the
floor, asked whether the bath was to be prepared at once,
and what Herr Wahnschaffe desired for breakfast. And he
did all this with complete seriousness, with an almost melancholy
seriousness, and with a certain charm within the rôle
he was assuming that could not fail to be pleasing.</p>

<p>Christian was forced to laugh. He held out his hand to
Crammon. But the latter, refusing to abandon his acting,
drew back, and bowed in embarrassment. He pulled the curtains
aside, opened the windows, spread the fresh shirt, the
socks, the cravat, and went, only to return a little later with
the breakfast tray. After he had set the table and put the
plates and cups in order, he stood with heels touching and
head gently inclined forward. Finally, when Christian laughed
again, the expression of his features altered, and he asked half-mockingly,
half-defiantly: “Are you still prepared to assert
that you can get along without me?”</p>

<p>“It’s impossible to close accounts with you, dear Bernard,”
Christian answered.</p>

<p>“It is not one of my habits to leave the table when only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the soup has been served,” Crammon said. “When my time
comes I trundle myself off without urging. But I don’t permit
myself to be sent away.”</p>

<p>“Stay, Bernard,” Christian answered. He was shamed by
his friend. “Only stay!” And their hands clasped.</p>

<p>But it almost seemed to Christian that his friend had really
in a sense become a servant, that he was one now, at all events,
toward whom one no longer had the duty of intimate openness,
with whom no inner bond united one&mdash;a companion merely.</p>

<p>From that time on, jests and superficial persiflage were
dominant in their conversations, and Crammon either did not
see or failed very intentionally to observe that his relations
with Christian had undergone a fundamental change.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The arrival of the Argentinian caused a commotion among
the guests of the house of Wahnschaffe. He had exotic habits.
He pressed the hands of the ladies to whom he was presented
with such vigour that they suppressed a cry of pain. Whenever
he came down the stairs he stopped a few steps from
the bottom, swung himself over the balustrade like an acrobat,
and went on as though this were the most natural thing in the
world. He had presented the countess with a Pekingese dog,
and whenever he met the animal he tweaked its ear so that it
howled horribly. And he did not do that merrily or with a
smile, but in a dry, businesslike manner.</p>

<p>Among the numerous trunks that he brought with him, one
was arranged in the form of a travelling pharmacy. Screwed
down tightly in neat compartments there were all possible
mixtures, powders, and medicaments; there were little boxes,
tubes, jars, and glasses. If any one complained of indisposition,
he at once pointed out the appropriate remedy in his
trunk, and recommended it urgently.</p>

<p>Felix Imhof had taken an enthusiastic fancy to him. Whenever
he could get hold of him, he took him aside, and ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>tioned
him regarding his country, his plans and undertakings,
his outer and his inner life.</p>

<p>Judith, who was jealous, resented this bitterly. She made
scenes for the benefit of Felix, and reproached Letitia for her
failure to absorb Stephen Gunderam’s attention.</p>

<p>Letitia was astonished, and her eyes grew large. With innocent
coquetry she asked: “What can I do about it?”</p>

<p>Judith’s answer was cynical. “One must study to please
the men.”</p>

<p>She hated the Argentinian. Yet when she was alone with
him she sought to ensnare him. Had it been possible to
alienate him from Letitia, she would have done so out of sheer
insatiableness.</p>

<p>Her eyes glittered with a constant and secret desire. She
went to the theatre with Imhof, Letitia, and Stephen to see
Edgar Lorm in “The Jewess of Toledo.” The applause which
was so richly given to the actor stirred the very depth of
her soul and filled it with more piercing desire. But whether
she desired the man or the artist, his art or his fame, she was
herself unable to tell.</p>

<p>She waited impatiently for Crammon, of whose friendship
with Lorm she had heard. He was to bring the actor to the
house with him. She was accustomed to have all men come
after whom she cast her hook. They usually bit, were served
up, and then enjoyed in proportion to their excellence of
flavour. The household consumption of people was large.</p>

<p>But Crammon and Christian did not return until Lorm’s
visit to Frankfort was over. So Judith fell into an evil mood,
and tormented all about her without reason. Had her wish
been fulfilled, her flickering soul, that needed ever new nourishment,
might have been calmed. Now she buried herself
stubbornly in the thought of what had passed by her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Crammon and Christian had been spending a week with
Clementine and Franz Lothar von Westernach in Styria.
Clementine had summoned Crammon for the sake of her
brother, who had recently returned from a stay in Hungary
with a deeply shaken mind.</p>

<p>Crammon and Franz Lothar were very old friends. The
latter’s profession of diplomacy had made the frank and
flexible man reserved and difficult. He took his profession seriously,
although he did not love it. A hypochondriacal state
of the nerves had developed in him, even in his youth.</p>

<p>Christian’s sympathy went out to him in his present state.
He felt tempted to question the man who sat so still and with
a dim stare in his eyes. Clementine, in her empty chattering
manner, gave Crammon directions for his behaviour, at which
he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>She said that she had written to her cousin, Baron Ebergeny,
on whose estate in Syrmia Franz had been a guest. But the
baron, who was half a peasant, had been able to give her no
explanation of any real import. He had merely pointed out
that he and Franz Lothar, on one of the last days of the latter’s
presence, had witnessed the burning of a barn at Orasje,
a neighbouring village, during which many people had lost
their lives.</p>

<p>No information was to be obtained from Franz Lothar himself.
He was steadily silent. His sister redoubled her care,
but his sombre reticence only increased. Perhaps Crammon
was capable of some tone, some glance, that pierced and melted
his petrified soul. One evening, at all events, the unexpected
happened. Crammon learnt that the burning of the barn was
the real cause of his morbid melancholy.</p>

<p>According to her custom, Clementine had gone to bed early.
Christian, Crammon, and Franz Lothar sat silently together.
Suddenly&mdash;without any external impetus&mdash;Franz covered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
face with his hands, and deep sobs came from his breast.
Crammon sought to soothe him. He stroked his hair and
grasped his hands. In vain. The sobbing became a convulsion
that shook the man’s body violently.</p>

<p>Christian sat without moving. A bitterness rose in his
throat, for there came to him with unexpected power a sense
of the essential reality of the spiritual pain that was being
uttered here.</p>

<p>The convulsion ceased as suddenly as it had begun. Franz
Lothar arose, walked up and down with dragging footsteps,
and said: “You shall hear how it was.” Thereupon he sat
down and told them.</p>

<p>In the village of Orasje a dance had been planned. No hall
was available, and so the large, well-boarded barn of a peasant
was prepared. Numerous lamps were hung up, and the wooden
walls adorned with flowers and foliage. According to a local
custom, the magnates on all the neighbouring estates and their
families received invitations to attend the festivity. A mounted
messenger delivered these solemnly by word of mouth.</p>

<p>Franz Lothar begged his brother to take him to the peasants’
ball. He had long heard stories in praise of the picturesqueness
of these feasts: the snow-white garments of the men, the
strong and varied colours of the women’s, the national dances,
the primitive music. There was a promise in all these, both
of pleasure and of a knowledge of new folk-ways.</p>

<p>They intended to drive over at a late hour when the dancing
had already begun. Two young countesses and the latters’
brother, all members of their circle, planned to join them. But
in the end the others went first, for the young ladies did not
want to miss any of the dancing. Franz Lothar had long
and cordially admired the Countess Irene, who was the older
of the two.</p>

<p>Several days before the ball, however, a quarrel had broken
out between the youths and maidens of Orasje. On the way to
church, a lad, whom a seventeen-year-old beauty had given too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
rude an evidence of her dislike, had put a live mouse on her
naked shoulder. The girl ran crying to her companions, and
they sent an envoy to the youths, demanding that the guilty
one apologize.</p>

<p>The demand was refused. There was laughter and teasing.
But they insisted on this punishment, although they were
repeated their demand in a more drastic form. When it was
refused a second time they determined to invite to their ball
the young men of Gradiste, between whom and those of Orasje
there was a feud of many years’ standing. They knew the
insult they were inflicting on the youths of their own village.
But they insisted on this punishment, although they were
warned even by their fathers and mothers, and by loud and
silent threats which should have inspired them with fear.</p>

<p>The youths of Gradiste were, of course, loudly triumphant
over their cheap victory. On the evening of the dance they
appeared without exception, handsomely dressed, and accompanied
by their own village band. Of the youths of Orasje
not one was to be seen. In the twilight they passed in ghostly
procession through the streets of the village, and were then
seen no more.</p>

<p>The elders and the married folk of Orasje sat at tables in
their yards and gardens, and chatted. But they were not as
care-free as on other festive evenings, for they felt the vengeful
mood of their sons, and feared it. They drank their wine
and listened to the music. In the barn over three hundred
young people were assembled. The air was sultry, and the
dancers were bathed in sweat. Suddenly, while they were
dancing a Czarda, the two great doors of the barn were simultaneously
slammed to from without. Those who saw it and
heard it ceased dancing. And now a powerful and disturbing
noise broke in upon the loud and jubilant sound of the instruments.
It was the sound of hammers, and a sharp and terror-shaken
voice called out: “They are nailing up the doors.”</p>

<p>The music stopped. In a moment the atmosphere had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
become suffocating. As though turned to stone, they all stared
at the doors. Their blood seemed to congeal under the terrible
blows of the hammers. Loud and mingled voices came to them
from without. The older people there raised their protesting
voices. The voices grew loud and wild, and then rose to desperate
shrieks and howls. Then it began to crackle and hiss.
The blows of the hammers had shaken down a lamp. The
petroleum had caught on fire, and the dry boarding of the
floor flared like tinder that could no longer be extinguished.</p>

<p>All reason and all human restraints fled. In the twinkling
of an eye the three hundred became like wild beasts. With
the violence of mania the youths hurled themselves against
the locked doors; but these had been built of heavy oak, and
resisted all exertions. The girls shrieked madly; and since
the smoke and the fumes did not all float out through the
cracks in the walls and through the small, star-shaped window-holes,
the girls drew up their skirts about their heads. Others
threw themselves moaning to the floor; and when they were
trodden on by the others, who surged so madly to and fro,
they writhed convulsively, and stretched out their arms. Soon
the dry woodwork had become a mass of flame. The heat was
intolerable. Many tore off their garments, both youths and
maidens, and in the terror and the torment of death, united
in the wild embraces of a sombre ecstasy, and wrung from their
doomed lives an ultimate sting of delight.</p>

<p>These embracing couples Franz Lothar saw later with his
own eyes as lumps of cinders amid the smoking ruins. He
arrived with his cousin, when the whole horror had already
taken place. They had seen the reflection of the flames in
the sky from afar, and whipped up their horses. From the
neighbouring villages streamed masses of people. But they
came too late to help. The barn had been burned down within
five minutes, and all within, except five or six, had found their
death.</p>

<p>Among the victims was also the Countess Irene, her sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and brother. Terrible as this was, it added but little to the
unspeakable horror of the whole catastrophe. The image of
that place of ruins; the sight of the smouldering corpses; their
odour and the odour of blood and burned hair and garments;
the pied, short-haired village dogs, who crept with greedy
growls about this vast hearth of cooked flesh; the distorted
faces of the suffocated, whose bodies lay untouched amid the
other burned and blackened ones; the loud or silent grief of
mothers, fathers, brothers; the Syrmian night, fume-filled to
the starry sky,&mdash;these things rained blow on blow upon the
spirit of Franz Lothar, and caused a black despair to creep
into the inmost convolutions of his brain.</p>

<p>It eased him that he had at last found the release of speech.
He sat by the window, and looked out into the dark.</p>

<p>Crammon, a sinister cloud upon his lined forehead, said:
“Only with a whip can the mob be held in leash. What I regret
is the abolition of torture. The devil take all humanitarian
twaddle!” Then he went out and put his arms about Lothar
and kissed him.</p>

<p>But Christian felt a sense of icy chill and rigidness steal over
him.</p>

<p>Their departure was set for the next morning. Crammon
entered the room of Christian, who was so lost in thoughts
that he did not reply to the greeting of his friend. “Look here,
what’s wrong with you?” Crammon exclaimed, as he examined
him. “Have you looked in the glass?”</p>

<p>Christian had dispensed with his valet on this trip, or the
slight accident could not have happened. The colours of his
suit and his cravat presented an obvious discord.</p>

<p>“I’m rather absent-minded to-day,” Christian said, half-smiling.
He took off the cravat, and replaced it by another.
It took him three times as long as usual. Crammon walked
impatiently up and down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Confusion seized upon Christian whenever he sought to think
about the condition in which he found himself.</p>

<p>In his breast there was an emptiness which nothing could
fill from without, and about him was a rigid armour that
hindered all freedom of movement. He yearned to fill the
emptiness and to burst the armour.</p>

<p>His mother became anxious, and said: “You look peaked,
Christian. Is anything wrong with you?” He assured her
that there was nothing. But she knew better, and inquired
of Crammon: “What ails Christian? He is so still and pale.”</p>

<p>Crammon answered: “Dear lady, that is his style of personality.
Experiences carve his face. Has it not grown nobler
and prouder? You need fear nothing. He follows his road
firmly and unwaveringly. And so long as I am with him,
nothing evil can happen to him.”</p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe was moved in her faint way, though
still in doubt, and gave him her hand.</p>

<p>Crammon said to Christian: “The countess has made a
great catch&mdash;a person from overseas. Quite fitting.”</p>

<p>“Do you like the man?” Christian asked, uncertainly.</p>

<p>“God forbid that I should think evil of him,” Crammon
replied, hypocritically. “He is from so far away, and will
go so far away again, that I cannot but find him congenial.
If he takes that child Letitia with him, he shall be accompanied
by my blessings. Whether it will mean her happiness,
that is a matter I refuse to be anxious about. Such remote distances
have, at all events, something calming. The Argentine,
the Rio de la Plata! Dear me, it might just as well be the
moon!”</p>

<p>Christian laughed. Yet the figure of Crammon, as it stood
there before him, seemed to dissolve into a mist, and he
suppressed what he still had to say.</p>

<p>Twenty-three of the guest rooms were occupied. People<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
arrived and left. Scarcely did one begin to recognize a face,
when it disappeared again. Men and women, who had met
but yesterday, associated quite intimately to-day, and said
an eternal farewell to-morrow. A certain Herr von Wedderkampf,
a business associate of the elder Wahnschaffe, had
brought his four daughters. Fräulein von Einsiedel arranged
to settle down for the winter, for her parents were in process of
being divorced. Wolfgang, who was spending his vacation
at home, had brought with him three student friends. All
these people were in a slightly exalted mood, made elaborate
plans for their amusement, wrote letters and received them,
dined, flirted, played music, were excited and curious, witty
and avid for pleasure, continued to carry on their worldly
affairs from here, and assumed an appearance of friendliness,
innocence, and freedom from care.</p>

<p>Liveried servants ran up and down the stairs, electric bells
trilled, motor car horns tooted, tables were laid, lamps shone,
jewels glittered. Behind one door they flirted, behind another
they brewed a scandal. In the hall with the fair marble
columns sat smiling couples. It was a world thoroughly differentiated
from those quite accidental modern groupings at
places where one pays. It was full of a common will to oblige,
of secret understandings, and of social charm.</p>

<p>Letitia had gone with her aunt to spend a week in Munich.
She did not return until the third day after Christian’s arrival.
Christian was glad to see her. Yet he could not bring himself
to enter into conversation with her.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>One morning he sat at breakfast with his father. He marvelled
how strange to him was this gentleman with the white,
parted hair, with the elegantly clipped and divided beard and
the rosy complexion.</p>

<p>Herr Wahnschaffe treated him with very great courtesy.
He inquired after the social relations that Christian had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
formed in England, and commented upon his son’s frugal
answers with instructive remarks concerning men and things.
“It is well for Germans to gain ground there&mdash;useful and
necessary.”</p>

<p>He discussed the threatening clouds in the political sky, and
expressed his disapproval of Germany’s attitude during the
Moroccan crisis. But Christian remained silent, through want
of interest and through ignorance, and his father became visibly
cooler, took up his paper, and began to read.</p>

<p>What a stranger he is to me, Christian thought, and searched
for a pretext that would let him rise and leave. At that
moment Wolfgang came to the table, and talked about the
results of the races at Baden-Baden. His voice annoyed
Christian, and he escaped.</p>

<p>It happened that Judith was sitting in the library and
teased him about Letitia. Then Letitia herself and Crammon
entered chatting. Felix Imhof soon joined them. Letitia took
a book, and carefully avoided, as was clear, looking in Christian’s
direction. Then those three left the room again, and
Judith listened with pallor to their retreating voices, for she
had heard Felix pay Letitia a compliment. “Perhaps she is
committing a great folly,” she said. Then she turned to her
brother. “Why are you so silent?” She wrinkled her forehead,
and rested her folded hands on his shoulder. “We are all
merry and light hearted here, and you are so changed. Don’t
you like to be among us? Isn’t it lovely here at home? And
if you don’t like it, can’t you go at any time? Why are you
so moody?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know; I am not moody,” Christian replied. “One
cannot always be laughing.”</p>

<p>“You’ll stay until my wedding, won’t you?” Judith continued,
and raised her brows. “I’ll never forgive you if you
don’t.” Christian nodded, and then she said with a friendly
urgency, “Why don’t you ever talk to me, you bear? Ask
me something!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian smiled. “Very well, I’ll ask you something,” he
said. “Are you contented, Judith? Is your heart at peace?”</p>

<p>Judith laughed. “That’s asking too much at once! You
used not to be so forthright.” Then she leaned forward, with
her elbows on her knees, and spread out her hands. “We
Wahnschaffes can never be contented. All that we have is
too little, for there is always so much that one has not.
I’m afraid I shall be like the fisherman’s wife in the fairy tale.
Or, rather, I’m not afraid but glad at the thought that I’ll
send my fisherman back to the fish in the sea again and again.
Then I shall know, at least, what he is willing to risk.”</p>

<p>Christian regarded his beautiful sister, and heard the
temerity of her words. There was an audacity about her
gestures, her words, her bright, clear voice, and the glow of
her eyes. He remembered how he had sat one evening with
Eva Sorel; and she had been as near him as Judith was now.
In silent ecstasy he had looked at Eva’s hands, and she had
raised her left hand and held it against the lamp, and though
the radiance outlined only the more definitely the noble form
of the rosy translucence of her flesh, the dark shadow of the
bony structure had been plainly visible. And Eva had said:
“Ah, Eidolon, the kernel knows nothing of beauty.”</p>

<p>Christian arose and asked almost sadly: “You will know
what he risks. But will that teach you to know what you
gain?”</p>

<p>Judith looked up at him in surprise, and her face darkened.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>One day he entered the sitting-room of his mother, but she
was not there. He approached the door that led to her bedroom,
and knocked. When he received no answer, he opened
it. She was not in this room either. Looking about, he became
aware of a brown silk dress trimmed with lace that belonged to
his mother and that had been put on a form. And for a second
he seemed to see her before him, but without a head. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fell to thinking, and the same thought came to him that he had
had in his father’s presence: What a stranger she is to me!
And the dress, that hid only the wicker form, became an image
of his mother, more recognizable to him than her living body.</p>

<p>For there was about her something impenetrable and inexplicable&mdash;the
rigid attitude, the hopeless mien, the dull eye,
the rough voice that had no resonance, her whole joyless character.
She, in whose house all made merry, and whose whole
activity and being seemed dedicated to give others the opportunity
of delight, was herself utterly barren of joy.</p>

<p>But she had the most magnificent pearls in Europe. And
all men knew this and esteemed her for it and boasted of it.</p>

<p>Christian’s self-deception went so far, that he was about to
talk to that hollow form more intimately than he would have
done to his living mother. A question leaped to his lips, a
tender and cheerful word. Then he heard her footsteps, and
was startled. He turned around, and seemed to see her double.</p>

<p>She was not surprised at meeting him here. She was rarely
surprised at anything. She sat down on a chair and her eyes
were empty.</p>

<p>She discussed Imhof, who had introduced a Jewish friend
of his to the house. She deprecated association with Jews as
a practice. She added that Wahnschaffe&mdash;she always called
her husband so&mdash;agreed with her.</p>

<p>She expressed her disapproval of Judith’s engagement.
“Wahnschaffe is really opposed to this marriage too,” she
said, “but it was difficult to find a pretext to refuse. If
Judith sets her heart on anything! Well, you know her! I
am afraid her chief ambition was to get ahead of her friend
Letitia.”</p>

<p>Christian looked up in amazement. His mother did not observe
it, and continued: “With all his good qualities Imhof
does not seem reliable. He is a plunger, and restless and
changeable as a weather vane. Of the ten millions which
his foster father left him, five or six are already lost through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
speculation and extravagance. What is your judgment of
him?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t really thought about it,” Christian answered.
This conversation was beginning to weary him.</p>

<p>“Then, too, his origin is obscure. He was a foundling. Old
Martin Imhof, whom Wahnschaffe knew, by the way, and who
belonged to one of the first patrician families of Düsseldorf,
is said to have adopted him under peculiar circumstances.
He was an old bachelor, and had a reputation for misanthropy.
At last he was quite alone in the world, and absolutely adored
this strange child. Hadn’t you heard about that?”</p>

<p>“Some rumour, yes,” Christian said.</p>

<p>“Well, now tell me something about yourself, my son,”
Frau Wahnschaffe asked, with a changed expression and with
a smile of suffering.</p>

<p>But Christian had no answer. His world and his mother’s
world&mdash;he saw no bridge between the two. And as the knowledge
came to him, another matter also became clear. And
it was this, that there was likewise no bridge between the
world of his conscious life and another that lay far behind
it, misty and menacing, luring and terrible at once, which he
did not understand, nor know, of which he had not even a
definite presage, but which had come to him only as a vision
through flashes of lightning, or as a dream or in a swift touch
of horror.</p>

<p>He kissed his mother’s hand, and hastened out.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>In spite of a gently persistent rain, he walked with Letitia
through the twilit park. Many times they wandered up and
down the path from the hot-houses to the pavillion, and heard
the sound of a piano from the house. Fräulein von Einsiedel
was playing.</p>

<p>At first their conversation was marked by long pauses.
Something in Letitia was beseeching: Take me, take me!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Christian understood. He wore his arrogant smile, but he did
not dare to look at her. “I love music heard from afar,”
Letitia said. “Don’t you, Christian?”</p>

<p>He drew his raincoat tighter about him, and replied: “I
care little about music.”</p>

<p>“Then you have a bad heart, or at least a hard one.”</p>

<p>“It may be that I have a bad heart; it is certainly hard.”</p>

<p>Letitia flushed, and asked: “What do you love? I mean
what things. What?” The archness of her expression did
not entirely conceal the seriousness of her question.</p>

<p>“What things I love?” he repeated lingeringly, “I don’t
know. Does one have to love things? One uses them. That
is all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Letitia cried, and her deep voice brought a
peculiar warmth to Christian. “Oh, no! Things exist to be
loved. Flowers, for instance, and stars. One loves them. If
I hear a beautiful song or see a beautiful picture, at once something
cries within me: That is mine, mine!”</p>

<p>“And do you feel that too when a bird suddenly drops down
and dies, as you have seen it happen? Or when a wounded
deer dies before you when you are hunting?” Christian asked,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Letitia was silent, and looked at him with a touch of fear.
The glance of her eyes was inexpressibly grateful to him. Take
me, take me, that silent voice pleaded with him again. “But
those are not things,” she said softly, “they are living
beings.”</p>

<p>His voice was gentler than hitherto when he spoke again:
“All things that are fragrant and glowing, that serve adornment
and delight are yours indeed, Letitia. But what are
mine?” He stood still, and asked again with a look of inner
distress which shook Letitia’s soul. Never had she expected
such words or such a tone of him.</p>

<p>Her glance reminded him: you kissed me once! Think of
it&mdash;you kissed me once!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“When is your wedding going to be?” he asked, and his
lids twitched a little.</p>

<p>“I don’t know exactly. We’re not even formally engaged
at present,” Letitia answered, laughing. “He has declared
that I must be his wife and won’t be contradicted. Christmas
my mother is coming to Heidelberg, and then, I suppose, the
wedding will take place. What I do look forward to is the
voyage overseas and the strange country.” And in her radiant
eyes flamed up the impassioned plea: Oh, take me, take me!
My yearning is so great! But with a coquettish turn of the
head, she asked: “How do you like Stephen?”</p>

<p>He did not answer her question, but said softly: “Some one
is watching us from the house.”</p>

<p>Letitia whispered: “He is jealous of the very earth and
air.” It began to rain harder, and so they turned their steps
toward the house. And Christian felt that he loved her.</p>

<p>An hour later he entered the smoking room. Imhof, Crammon,
Wolfgang, and Stephen Gunderam sat about a round table,
and played poker. The demeanour of each accorded with his
character: Imhof was superior and talkative, Crammon absent-minded
and sombre, Wolfgang distrustful and excited. Stephen
Gunderam’s face was stonily impassive. He was as utterly
dedicated to his occupation as a somnambulist. He has been
winning uninterruptedly, and a little mountain of bank notes
and gold was rising in front of him. Crammon and Imhof
moved aside to make room for Christian. At that moment
Stephen jumped up. Holding his cards in his hand, he stared
at Christian with eyes full of hatred.</p>

<p>Christian regarded him with amazement. But when the
other three, rather surprised, also moved to get up, Stephen
Gunderam sank back into his chair, and said with sombre
harshness: “Let us play on. May I ask for four cards?”</p>

<p>Christian left the neighbourhood of the table. He felt that
he loved Letitia. His whole heart loved her, tenderly and with
longing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>A discharged workman had lain in wait one evening for the
automobile of Herr Albrecht Wahnschaffe. When the car
slowed up and approached the gate of the park, the assassin,
hidden by the bushes, had stealthily shot at his former employer.</p>

<p>The bullet only grazed its victim’s arms. The wound was
slight, but Albrecht Wahnschaffe had to remain in bed for
several days. After his deed the criminal had escaped under
cover of darkness. It was not until next morning that the
police succeeded in catching him.</p>

<p>This happening, inconsiderable as were its consequences, had
disturbed for a little the merry life in the house of Wahnschaffe.
Several persons left. Among these was Herr von Wedderkampf,
who told his daughters that the ground here was getting
too hot for his feet.</p>

<p>But on the third evening every one was dancing again.</p>

<p>It surprised Christian. He did not understand such swift
forgetfulness. He was surprised at the equanimity of his
mother, the care-free mood of his sister and brother.</p>

<p>He wished to learn the name of that workingman, but no
one knew. He was told that the man’s name was Müller.
Also that it was Schmidt. He was surprised. Nor did any
one seem to know exactly what motive impelled the man to
his deed. One said that it had been mere vengefulness, the
result of the flame of class hatred systematically fanned.
Another said that only a lunatic could be capable of such
a deed.</p>

<p>Whatever it was, this shot fired from ambush by an unknown
man for an unknown cause was not quite the same to Christian
as it was to all the others who lived about him and sought
their pleasure in their various ways. It forced him to meditation.
His meditation was aimless and fruitless enough. But
it was serious, and caused him strange suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>He would have liked to see the man. He would have liked
to look into his face.</p>

<p>Crammon said: “Another case that makes it clear as day
that the discarding of torture has simply made the canaille
more insolent. What admirable inventions for furthering discipline
and humanity were the stocks and the pillory!”</p>

<p>Christian visited his father, who sat in an armchair with
his arm in a sling. A highly conservative newspaper was spread
out before him. Herr Wahnschaffe said: “I trust that you
and your friends are not practising any undue restraint. I
could not endure the thought of darkening the mood of my
guests by so much as a breath.”</p>

<p>Christian was astonished at this courtesy, this distinction
and temperance, this amiable considerateness.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Deep in the woods, amid ruins, Stephen Gunderam demanded
of Letitia that she decide his fate.</p>

<p>A picnic in very grand style had been arranged; Letitia
and Stephen had remained behind here; and thus it had happened.</p>

<p>Around them arose the ancient tree-trunks and the immemorial
walls. Above the tree-tops extended the pallid blue
of the autumnal sky. His knees upon the dry foliage, a man,
using sublime and unmeasured words, asserted his eternal love.
Letitia could not withstand the scene and him.</p>

<p>Stephen Gunderam said: “If you refuse me nothing is left
me but to put a bullet through my head. I have had it in
readiness for long. I swear to you by the life of my father
that I speak truly.”</p>

<p>Could a girl as gentle and as easily persuaded as Letitia
assume the responsibility for such blood-guiltiness? And she
gave her consent. She did not think of any fetter, nor of the
finality of such a decision, nor of time nor of its consequences,
nor of him to whom her soul was to belong. She thought only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of this moment, and that there was one here who had spoken to
her these sublime and unmeasured words.</p>

<p>Stephen Gunderam leaped up, folded her in his arms and
cried: “From now on you belong to me through all eternity&mdash;every
breath, every thought, every dream of yours is mine
and mine only! Never forget that&mdash;never!”</p>

<p>“Let me go, you terrible man!” Letitia said, but with a
shiver of delight. She felt herself carried voluptuously upon
a wave of romance. Her nerves began to vibrate, her glance
shimmered and broke. For the first time she felt the stir of
the flesh. With a soft cry she glided from his grasp.</p>

<p>Even on the way home they received congratulations. Crammon
slunk quietly away. When Christian came and gave
Letitia his hand, there was in her eyes a restless expectation,
a fantastic joy that he could not understand at all. He could
not fathom what she hid behind this expression. He could not
guess that even at this moment she was faithlessly withdrawing
herself from him to whom she had just entrusted her life, its
every breath and thought and dream, and that in her innocent
but foolish way she desired to convey to Christian a sense of
this fact.</p>

<p>He loved her. From hour to hour his love grew. He felt it
to be almost an inner law that he must love her&mdash;a command
which said to him: This is she to whom you must turn; a
message whose burden was: In her shall you find yourself.</p>

<p>He seemed to be hearing the voice of Eva: Your path was
from me to her. I taught you to feel. Now give that feeling to
a waiting heart. You can shape it and mould it and yourself.
Let it not be extinguished nor flicker out and die.</p>

<p>Thus the inner voice seemed to speak.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Crammon, the thrice hardened, had a dream wherein some
one reproved him for standing by idly, while his flesh and
blood was being sold to an Argentinian ranchman. So he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
went to the countess, and asked her if she indeed intended
to send the tender child into a land of savages. “Don’t you
feel any dread at the thought of her utter isolation in these
regions of the farthest South?” he asked her, and rolled his
hands in and out, which gave him the appearance of an elderly
usurer.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking of, Herr von Crammon?” The
countess was indignant. “What right have you to question
me? Or do you happen to know a better man for her, a
wealthier, more distinguished, more presentable one? Do you
imagine one can be happy only in Europe? I’ve had a look
at a good many people. They ran after us by the dozen at
Interlaken, Aix-les-Bains, at Geneva and Zürich and Baden-Baden&mdash;old
and young, Frenchmen and Russians, Germans
and Englishmen, counts and millionaires. We didn’t start out
with any particular craze for the exotic. Your friend Christian
can bear witness to that! But he, I dare say, thought himself
too good for us. It’s bad enough that I have to let my
darling go across the ocean, without your coming to me and
making my heart heavier than ever!”</p>

<p>But Crammon was not to be talked down. “Consider the
matter very carefully once more,” he said. “The responsibility
is tremendous. Do you realize that venomous snakes
exist in those regions whose bite kills within five seconds?
I have read of storms that uproot the most powerful trees and
overturn houses nine stories high. So far as I have been
informed, certain tribes native to Terra del Fuego still practise
cannibalism. Furthermore, there are species of ants
that attack human beings and devour them bodily. The heat
of summer is said to be insufferable, and equally so the cold
of winter. It is an inhospitable region, countess, and a dirty
one with dangerous inhabitants. I want you to consider the
whole matter carefully once more.”</p>

<p>The countess was rather overcome. Delighted with the
effect of his words, Crammon left her with head erect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>That evening, when Letitia was already in bed, the countess,
with arms crossed on her bosom, walked up and down in the
girl’s room. Her conscience was heavy, but she hardly knew
how to begin a discussion. All afternoon she had been writing
letters and addressing announcements of the engagement, and
now she was tired. The little dog, Puck, meanwhile sat on a
silken pillow in the adjoining room, and barked shrilly and
without cause from time to time.</p>

<p>Letitia stared into the dim space above her with eyes that
gleamed softly with the mystery of dreams. So rapt was she
that if one had pressed a pin into her flesh she would not have
noticed it.</p>

<p>At last the countess conquered herself sufficiently. She sat
down near the bed, and took Letitia’s hands into her own.
“Is it true, sweetheart,” she began, “and did Stephen tell you
about all these things that Herr von Crammon speaks of&mdash;venomous
snakes and cannibals and tornadoes and wild ants
and frightful heat and cold in this terrible country that you’re
going to? If all this is true, I want to beseech you to reconsider
very thoroughly this step that you’re about to take.”</p>

<p>Letitia laughed a deep and hearty laugh. “Are you beginning
to get frightened now, auntie?” she cried, “just as I’ve
been dreaming about the future! Crammon has played an
ill-timed prank. That is all. Stephen never lies, and according
to his description the Argentine is a veritable earthly
paradise. Do listen, auntie!” She said this with an air of
mystery, moved to the edge of her bed, and regarded the
countess full of confidence and delight. “The land is full of
peaches as large as a child’s head and of the most exquisite
flavour. They are so plentiful that those that cannot be eaten
or sold are piled up in great heaps and burned. They have
game of all sorts, which they prepare in wonderful ways quite
unknown in Europe, and fishes and fowl and honey, the rarest
vegetables, and everything that the heart can desire.”</p>

<p>The countess’ face brightened. She petted Letitia’s arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and said: “Well, of course, in that case, and if it is really
so....”</p>

<p>But Letitia went on: “When I’ve become thoroughly acclimated
and familiar with everything, I’ll ask you, dear aunt, to
come out to us. You’ll have a house of your own, a charming
villa all overgrown with flowers. Your pantries shall be filled
afresh daily and you shall have a marble bath next to your
bedroom. You’ll be able to get into it as often as you like, and
you will have Negro women to wait on you.”</p>

<p>“That is right, my darling,” the countess answered, and her
face was transfigured with delight. “Whether it’s a paradise
or not, I am pretty sure that it will be dirty. And dirt, as you
know, is something I hate almost as much as poisonous serpents
or cannibals.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid, auntie,” said Letitia, “we’ll lead a wonderful
life there.”</p>

<p>The countess was calmed, and embraced Letitia with overwhelming
gratitude.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>In order to escape from the confusion at Wahnschaffe
Castle, as the new house was known, Christian and Crammon
retired for several days to Christian’s Rest. Scarcely had
they settled down, when they were joined by Judith and her
companion, by Letitia and Fräulein von Einsiedel.</p>

<p>The countess and Stephen Gunderam had gone to Heidelberg,
where they were expecting Frau von Febronius. Letitia
was to follow them a week later. Felix had been summoned
to Leipzig, where he was to join in the founding of a great
new publishing house. After his return to the castle, his and
Judith’s wedding was to take place.</p>

<p>Judith announced that she intended to enjoy the last days of
her liberty. It had not needed much persuasion to bring
Letitia with her. The companion and Fräulein von Einsiedel
were regarded as chaperones, and so with laughter and merri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>ment
these four surprised Christian and Crammon suddenly.</p>

<p>The weather was beautiful, though somewhat cold. They
passed most of their time out of doors, walking in the woods,
playing golf, arranging picnics. The evenings flew by in cheerful
talk. Once Crammon read to them Goethe’s “Torquato
Tasso,” and imitated the intonation and the rhythms of Edgar
Lorm so deceptively that Judith grew excited and could not
hear enough. She was attracted by the very imitation that he
practised; to Letitia the verses were like wine; Fräulein von
Einsiedel, who had been mourning a lost love for years, struggled
with her tears at many passages. Judith, on the other
hand, saw an adored image in a magic mirror, and when the
reading was over, turned the conversation to Lorm, and besought
Crammon to tell her about him.</p>

<p>Crammon did as she desired. He told her of the actor’s
romantic friendship with a king, of his first marriage to a
fair-haired Jewess. He had loved her madly, and she had left
him suddenly and fled to America. He had followed her
thither, and tracked her from place to place, but all his efforts
to win her back had been in vain. He had returned in grave
danger of losing himself and wasting his talent. Lonely and
divided in his soul, he had tried to settle in various places. He
had broken his contracts, been outlawed by the managers, and
barely tolerated by the public as a dangerous will o’ the
wisp. At last, however, his genius had fought down all unfortunate
circumstances as well as the weaknesses of his own
nature, and he was now the most radiant star in the heaven of
his art.</p>

<p>When Crammon had ended, Judith came up to him and
stroked his cheeks. “That was charming, Crammon. I want
you to be rewarded.”</p>

<p>Crammon laughed in his deepest bass voice, and answered:
“Then I ask as my reward that you four ladies return to-morrow
morning to the castle, and leave my friend Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and me to each other’s silence. Isn’t it true, Christian, dear
boy? We like to brood over the mysteries of the world.”</p>

<p>“The brute!” they cried out, “the traitor! The base
intriguer!” But it was only a jesting indignation. Their return
had really been set for the next day.</p>

<p>Christian arose and said: “Bernard is not wrong when he
says we desire silence. It is lovely to be surrounded by loveliness.
But you girls are too restless and unquiet.” He had
spoken in jest. But as he passed his hand over his forehead,
one could see the deep seriousness in his heart.</p>

<p>They all looked at him. There was something strangely
proud about his appearance. Letitia’s heart beat. When he
looked at her, her eyes fell and she blushed deeply. She loved
all that he was, all that lay behind him, all that he had experienced,
all women he had loved, all men from whom he
came or to whom he went.</p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered the little golden toad. She had
brought it with her and she determined to give it to him to-day.
But to do that she wanted to be alone with him.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>It was her wish that their meeting be at night, and she gave
him a sign. Unnoticed by the others, she succeeded in whispering
to him that she would come to him that night with a
gift. He was to wait for her.</p>

<p>He looked at her without a word. When she glided away,
his lips throbbed.</p>

<p>After midnight, when all were asleep in the house, she left
her chamber, and mounted to the upper floor where Christian
had his rooms. She went softly but without especial fear.
Bending her head forward, she held in her hands the folds of
the white silken over-garment that she wore. Its transparent
texture was more like a white shimmer, a pearly gleam upon her
flesh than a garment. It was doubled only about her waist
and bosom, and her steps were impeded by a satin riband about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
her knees. Thus, while her pulses throbbed, she had to trip,
to her own amusement, like the Geisha girls she had seen in a
theatre.</p>

<p>When Christian had locked the door behind her, she leaned
against it in sudden weakness.</p>

<p>Gently he took her wrists, and breathed a kiss upon her
forehead, smiled, and asked: “What did you want to bring to
me, Letitia? I long to know.”</p>

<p>Suddenly she was aware that she had forgotten the golden
toy. Shortly before she had left her room, she had laid it in
readiness; and yet she had forgotten it. “How stupid of me!”
The words slipped out, and she gazed in shame at her little
shoes of black velvet. “How stupid of me! There was a little
toad made of gold that I meant to bring to you.”</p>

<p>It startled him. Then he recalled the words that he had
spoken so many months ago. The intervening time seemed
thrice its natural length. He wondered now how he could
ever have been frightened of a toad. He could, to be sure, hear
his own words again: “Have a little toad made of gold, that
the evil magic may disappear.” But the monition had no
validity to-day. The spell had been broken without a talisman.</p>

<p>And as he saw the girl stand before him, quivering and
intoxicated, the trembling and the ecstasy seized him too.
Many others had come to him&mdash;none so innocent and yet so
guilty, none so determined and so deluded at once. He knew
those gestures, that silent yearning, the eye that flamed and
smouldered, the half-denial and the half-assent, the clinging
and repulsing, the sighs and the magical tears that tasted
like warm and salty dew. He knew! And his senses urged him
with all their power to experience and to taste it all again.</p>

<p>But there were things that stood between him and his
desire. There was a pallid brunette face whose eyes were
upon him with unimaginable clearness. There was a blood-soaked
face to which the black hair clung. There was a face
that had once been beautiful, swollen by the waters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Thames. And there was a face full of hatred and shame against
the coarse linen of a bed, and another in the storeroom of a
hotel which was swathed in a white cloth. There were other
faces&mdash;faces of men and women, thousands upon thousands, on
the shore of a river, and still others that were stamped upon
and charred, which he had seen as though they were concrete
realities through the eyes of another. All these things stood
between him and his desire.</p>

<p>And his heart opposed it too. And the love that he felt for
Letitia.</p>

<p>He grew a little paler, and a chill crept into his fingertips.
He took Letitia by the hand, and led her to the middle
of the room. She looked about her timidly, but every glance
was his who filled her whole being. She asked him concerning
the pictures that hung on the wall, and admired a picture of
himself which was among them. She asked after the meaning
of a little sculptured group which he had bought in Paris: a
man and a woman emerging from the earth of which they were
made, contending with primitive power.</p>

<p>Her deep voice had a more sensuous note than ever. And
as he answered her, the temptation assailed him anew to touch
with his lips the warm, rosy, throbbing curve of her shoulder,
which was like a ripe fruit. But an inescapable voice within
him cried: Resist once! Resist but this single time!</p>

<p>It was difficult, but he obeyed.</p>

<p>Letitia did not know what was happening to her. She
shivered, and begged him to close the window. But when he
had done so, her chill increased. She looked at him furtively.
His face seemed arrogant and alien. They had sat down on a
divan, and silence had fallen upon them. Why did I forget the
little toad? Letitia thought. My folly is to blame for everything.
And instinctively she moved away from him a little.</p>

<p>“Letitia,” he said, and arose, “perhaps you will understand
it all some day.” Then he kneeled on the floor at her feet, and
took her cool hands and laid them against his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t understand,” Letitia whispered, and her eyes
were wet, although she smiled, “and I shall never understand.”</p>

<p>“You will! Some day you will!”</p>

<p>“Never,” she asserted passionately, “never!” All things
were confused within her. She thought of flowers and stars,
of dreams and images. She thought of birds that fell dead out
of the air, as he had described them once, and a deer dying
at the hunter’s feet. She thought of paths upon which she
would go, of far sea-faring, and of jewels and costly garments.
But none of these images held her. They were formed and
dissolved. A chain broke in her soul, and she felt a need to lie
down and weep for a while. Not for long. And it was possible
that, when the weeping was over, she might look forward
with delight once more to the coming day and to Stephen
Gunderam and to their wedding.</p>

<p>“Good-night, Christian,” she said, and gave him her hand
as after a simple chat. And all the objects in the room had
changed their appearance. On the table stood a cut-glass bowl
full of meadow-saffron, and their white stalks were like the
antennæ of a polypus. The night outside was no longer the
same night. One seemed quite free now in a peculiar way&mdash;in
a defiant and vengeful way.</p>

<p>Christian was amazed by her gesture and posture. He had
not touched her; yet it was a girl who had come to him, and
it was a woman who went. “I will think about it,” she said,
and nodded to him with a great, dark look. “I will learn to
understand it.”</p>

<p>So she went&mdash;went on into her rich, poverty-stricken, adventurous,
difficult, trifling life.</p>

<p>Christian listened to the dying echo of her tread beyond the
door. He stood without moving, and his head was bent. To
him, too, the night had changed into another. Despite his
obedience to the inner voice, a doubt gnawed at his soul whether
what he had done was right or wrong, good or evil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>One day Christian received a letter that bore the signature
of Ivan Michailovitch Becker. Becker informed him that he
was staying for a short time in Frankfort, and that a woman,
a mutual friend, had insisted that he should visit Christian
Wahnschaffe. But this he would not do for well-considered
reasons. If, however, Christian Wahnschaffe’s state of mind
was such as their friend seemed to assume, he would be glad
to see him on some evening.</p>

<p>Eva’s name was not mentioned. But twice he spoke of that
woman who was their mutual friend&mdash;twice. And Becker
had added the street where he lived and the number of the
house.</p>

<p>Christian’s first impulse was to ignore the invitation. He
told himself that there was nothing in common between him
and Becker. The Russian had not been congenial to him. He
had disapproved and arrogantly overlooked the man’s friendship
with Eva. Whenever he thought of his ugly face, his
dragging gait, his sombre, silent presence, a sense of discomfort
seized upon him. What did the man want? Why
this summons in which there was a shadow of menace?</p>

<p>After he had tried in vain to keep from brooding over this
incident, he showed the letter to Crammon, in the secret hope
that his friend would warn him against any response. Crammon
read the letter, but shrugged his shoulders and said nothing.
Crammon was in a bad humour; Crammon was hurt.
He had felt for some time that Christian excluded him from
his confidence. In addition he was thinking far more of Eva
Sorel than was good for the peace of his soul. He paid ardent
attention to Fräulein von Einsiedel, nor was that lady unresponsive.
But this triumph could not restore the equilibrium
of his mind, and Becker’s letter opened his old wound anew.</p>

<p>Christian put an end to his vacillation by a sudden decision,
and started out to find Becker. The house was in the suburbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and he had to climb the four flights of stairs of a common
tenement. He was careful to come in contact with neither the
walls nor the balustrades. When he had reached the door and
pulled the bell, he was pale with embarrassment and disgust.</p>

<p>When Christian had entered the shabbily furnished room
and sat opposite Becker, what impressed him most was the
stamp of suffering on the Russian’s face. He asked himself
whether this was new or whether he had merely not perceived
it before. When Becker spoke to him, his answers
were shy and awkward.</p>

<p>“Madame Sorel is going to Petrograd in the spring,” Ivan
Michailovitch told him. “She has signed a three-months’
contract with the Imperial Theatre there.”</p>

<p>Christian expressed his pleasure at this information. “Are
you going to stay here long?” he asked, courteously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” was the answer. “I’m waiting for a
message here. Afterwards I shall join my friends in Switzerland.”</p>

<p>“My last conversation with Madame Sorel,” he continued,
“was exclusively about you.” He watched Christian attentively
out of his deep-set eyes.</p>

<p>“About me? Ah....” Christian forced himself to a
conventional smile.</p>

<p>“She insisted on my remaining in communication with you.
She said that it meant much to her, but gave no reason. She
never does give reasons, though. She insisted likewise that
I send her a report. Yet she did not even give me a message
for you. But she kept repeating: ‘It means something to
me, and it may mean very much to him.’ So you see that I am
only her instrument. But I hope that you are not angry with
me for annoying you.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” Christian asserted, although he felt oppressed.
“Only I can’t imagine what is in her mind.” He
sat there wondering, and added: “She has her very personal
ways!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Ivan Becker smiled, and the moisture of his thick lips became
unpleasantly visible. “It is very true. She is an enthusiastic
creature, and a woman of great gifts. She has power
over others, and is determined to use that power.”</p>

<p>A pause ensued.</p>

<p>“Can I be of assistance to you?” Christian asked conventionally.</p>

<p>Becker regarded him coldly. “No,” he said, “not of the
least.” He turned his eyes to the window, from which one
could see the chimneys of the factories, the smoke, and the
sinister snow-fraught air. Since the room was unheated, he
had a travelling rug spread across his knees, and under it he
hid his crippled hand. A movement of his limbs shifted the
rug, and the hand became visible. Christian knew the story of
it. Crammon had told him at the time in Paris of his meeting
and his talk with Becker. He had heard it with indifference,
and had avoided looking at the hand.</p>

<p>Now he regarded it. Then he got up, and with a gesture
of freedom and assurance, which astonished even Becker,
despite the Russian’s superficial knowledge of him, he held
out his own hand. Ivan Michailovitch gave him his left hand,
which Christian held long and pressed cordially. Then he left
without speaking another word.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>But on the following day he returned.</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch told him the story of his life. He
offered him a simple hospitality, made tea, and even had the
room heated. He spoke rather disconnectedly, with half-closed
eyes and a morbid, suffering smile. Now he would relate
episodes of his youth, now of his later years. The burden
was always the same: oppression, need, persecution, suffering&mdash;suffering
without measure. Wherever one went, one saw
crushed hearts, happiness stamped out, and personalities destroyed.
His parents had gone under in poverty, his brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and sisters had drifted away and were lost, his friends had
fallen in wars or died in exile. It was a life without centre or
light or hope&mdash;a world of hate and malevolence, cruelty and
darkness.</p>

<p>Christian sat there and listened until late into the night.</p>

<p>Next they met in a coffee house, an ugly place which
Christian would once not have endured, and sat until far into
the night. Often they sat in silence; and this silence tormented
Christian, and kept him in a state of unbearable tension. But
his expression was a gentle one.</p>

<p>They took walks along the river, or through the streets and
parks in the snow. Ivan Michailovitch spoke of Pushkin and
Byelinsky, of Bakunin and Herzen, of Alexander I and the legend
of his translation to heaven, and of the peasants&mdash;the
poor, dark folk. He spoke of the innumerable martyrs of forgotten
names, men and women whose actions and sufferings
beat at the heart of mankind, and whose blood, as he said, was
the red dawn of the sunrise of a new and other age.</p>

<p>So Christian kept disappearing from his home, and no one
knew where he went.</p>

<p>Once Ivan Michailovitch said: “I am told that a workingman
made a murderous assault on your father. The man was
condemned to seven years in the penitentiary yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true,” Christian replied. “What was his name?
I have forgotten it.”</p>

<p>It turned out that the man’s name was neither Schmidt nor
Müller, but Roderick Kroll. Ivan Michailovitch knew it.
“There’s a wife and five little children left in extreme distress,”
he said. “Have you ever tried for a moment to grasp imaginatively
what that means&mdash;real distress? Is your imagination
powerful enough to realize it? Have you ever seen the countenance
of a human being that suffered hunger? There is this
woman. She bore five children, and loves these children just
as your mother loves hers. Very well. The drawers are empty,
the hearth is cold, the bedding is in pawn, their clothes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
shoes are in rags. These children are human, each one, just
as you and I are. They have the same instinctive expectation
of content, bread, quiet sleep, and pure air, that you have or
Herr von Crammon or countless others, who never realize reflectively
that all these things are theirs. Very well. Now
the world does not only feign to know nothing of all this, not
only resents being reminded of it, but actually demands of
these beings that they are to be silent, that they accept and
endure hunger, nakedness, cold, disease, the theft of their
natural rights, and the insolent injustice of it all, as something
quite natural and inevitable. Have you ever thought about
that?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” Christian replied, softly, “that I have
never thought at all.”</p>

<p>“This man,” Ivan Michailovitch continued, “this Roderick
Kroll, so far as I have been able to learn, was systematically
exasperated to the very quick. He was an enthusiastic socialist,
but somewhat of an annoyance even to his own party on
account of his extreme views and his violent propaganda.
The masters dug the ground from under his feet. They embittered
him by the constant sting of small intrigues, and
drove him to despair. The intention was to render him harmless
and to force him to silence. But tell me this: is there an
extreme on the side of the oppressed that is so unfair, so insolent,
so damnable as the extreme on the other side&mdash;the arrogance,
luxury, revelling, the hardness of heart, and the insensate
extravagance of every day and every hour? You did
not even know the name of that man!”</p>

<p>Christian stood still. The wind blew the snow into his
face, and wet his forehead and cheeks. “What shall I do,
Ivan Michailovitch?” he asked, slowly.</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch stopped too. “What shall I do?” he
cried. “That is what they all ask. That is what Prince
Jakovlev Grusin asked, one of our chief magnates and marshal
of the nobility in the province of Novgorod. After he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
starved his peasants, plundered his tenants, sent his officials
to Siberia, violated girls, seduced women, driven his own sons
to despair, spent his life in gluttony, drunkenness, and whoring,
and heaped crime upon crime&mdash;he went into a monastery in
the seventy-fourth year of his age, and day after day kneeled in
his cell and cried: ‘What shall I do? My Lord and Saviour,
what shall I do?’ And no one, naturally, had an answer for
him. I have heard the question asked softly by another, whose
soul was clean and white. He was going to his death, and his
age was seventeen. Nine men with their rifles stood by the
trench of the fortress. He approached, reeling a little, and his
guiltless soul asked: ‘Father in Heaven, what shall I do?
What shall I do?’”</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch walked on, and Christian followed him.
“And we poor men, we terribly poor men,” Ivan Becker said,
“what shall <i>we</i> do?”</p>


<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>Judith’s wedding was to be celebrated with great magnificence.</p>

<p>Even to the preliminary festival more than two hundred
guests had been invited. There was no end to the line of
motor cars and carriages.</p>

<p>The coal and iron barons of the whole province appeared,
military and civil officials of high rank with their ladies, the
chief patricians and financiers of Frankfort, members of the
Court circles of Darmstadt and Karlsruhe, and friends from
afar. A tenor from Berlin, a famous lyric singer, a Viennese
comedian, a magician, and a juggler had been engaged to
furnish the guests with amusement.</p>

<p>The great horse-shoe table in the dining-hall, radiant with
gold, silver, and cut glass, had three hundred and thirty covers.</p>

<p>The festive throng surged up and down in the marble gallery
and the adjoining rooms. Yellow and rose predominated in the
toilettes of the ladies; the young girls were mostly in white.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Bare shoulders were agleam with diamonds and pearls. The
severe black and white of the men effectually softened the
gorgeousness of the colour scheme.</p>

<p>Christian was walking up and down with Randolph von
Stettner, a young lieutenant of hussars, stationed at Bonn.
They had been friends since their boyhood, had not seen each
other for several years, and were exchanging reminiscences.
Randolph von Stettner said that he was not very happy in his
profession; he would much rather have taken a university
degree. He had a strong taste for the study of chemistry, and
felt out of place as a soldier. “But it is futile to kick against
the pricks,” he ended, sighing; “a man must merely take the
bit between his teeth and keep still.”</p>

<p>Christian happened to observe Letitia, who stood in the
centre of a circle of men. Upon her forehead was forgetfulness;
she knew nothing of yesterday and nothing of to-morrow.
There was no one else so absorbed by the passing hour as she.</p>

<p>A footman approached Christian and gave him a card. The
footman frowned doubtfully, for the card was not quite clean.
On it Christian read these pencilled words: “I. M. Becker
must speak with you at once.” Hurriedly he excused himself
and went out.</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch stood perfectly still in the outer hall.
Newly arrived guests, who gave the footmen their hats and
coats, passed by without noticing him. The men took mincing
steps, the ladies sought the mirror for a final look with their
excited eyes.</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch wore a long grey coat, shabby and wet.
The black-bearded face was pale as wax. Christian drew him
into an empty corner of the hall, where they were undisturbed.</p>

<p>“I beg you to forgive me for throwing a shadow on all this
festivity,” Ivan Michailovitch began, “but I had no choice. I
received a notification of expulsion from the police this afternoon.
I must leave the city and the country within twelve
hours. The simple favour I ask of you is to take this note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>book
into your keeping, until I myself or some properly identified
friend asks it back.” He glanced swiftly about him, took
a thin, blue notebook out of his pocket, and gave it to
Christian, who slid it swiftly and unobtrusively into a pocket
of his evening coat.</p>

<p>“It contains memoranda in Russian,” Ivan continued,
“which have no value to any one but myself, but which must
not be found on me. Since I am being expelled there is little
doubt but that my person and effects will be searched.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you come and rest in my room?” Christian asked,
timidly. “Won’t you eat or drink something?”</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch shook his head. From the hall floated
the sound of the violins, playing an ingratiating air by Puccini.</p>

<p>“Won’t you at least dry your coat?” Christian asked again.
The strains of the music, the splendour there within, the merriment
and laughter, the fullness of beauty and happiness, all
this presented so sharp a contrast to the appearance of this
man in a wet coat, with wax-like face and morbidly flaming
eyes, that Christian could no longer endure his apparently unfeeling
position between these two worlds, of whose utter and
terrible alienation from each other he was acutely aware.</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch smiled. “It is kind of you to think of
my coat. But you can’t do any good. It will only get wet
again.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to take you, just as you are,” said Christian, and
he smiled too, “and go in there with you.”</p>

<p>Ivan Michailovitch shrugged his shoulders, and his face grew
dark.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should like to do that,” Christian
murmured. “I don’t know why it tempts me. I stand before
you, and you put me in the wrong. Whether I speak or am
silent does not matter. By merely being I am in the wrong.
We should not be conversing here in the servants’ corner. You
are making some demand of me, Ivan Michailovitch, are you
not? What is it that you demand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The words bore witness to a confusion of the emotions that
went to the very core of his being. They throbbed with the
yearning to become and to be another man. Ivan Michailovitch,
in a sudden flash of intuition, saw and understood. At
first he had suspected that here was but a lordly whim, or that it
was at best but the foolish and thoughtless defiance of a too
swiftly ardent proselyte that urged this proud and handsome
man to his words. He recognized his error now. He understood
that he heard a cry for help, and that it came from the
depth of one of those decisive moments of which life holds
but few.</p>

<p>“What is it that I am to demand of you, Christian Wahnschaffe?”
he asked, earnestly. “Surely not that you drag me
in there to your friends, and ask me to regard that as a definite
deed and as a triumph over yourself?”</p>

<p>“It would not be that,” Christian said, with lowered
eyes, “but a simple confession of my friendship and my
faith.”</p>

<p>“But consider what a figure I would cut in my blouse, taken
so unwillingly and emphatically, to use the Russian proverb,
into the realm of the spheres. You would be forgiven. You
would be accused of an eccentricity, and laughed at; but it
would be overlooked. But what would happen to me? You
could guard me from obvious insult. The profound humiliation
of my position would still be the same. And what purpose
would such a boastful action serve? Do you see any promise
of good in it&mdash;for myself, or you, or the others? I could accuse
no one, persuade no one, convince no one. Nor would you
yourself be convinced.”</p>

<p>He was silent for a few seconds, and then regarded Christian
with a kind and virile glance. Then he continued. “Had I
appeared in evening clothes, this whole conversation would be
without meaning. That shows how trivial it is. Why,
Christian Wahnschaffe, should I exhibit my blouse and coat
amid the garb of your friends? Do you go with me to a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
where your coat is a blasphemy and a stain, and where my
rough, wet one is a thing of pride and advantage. I know such
a house. Go with me!”</p>

<p>Christian, without answering a word, summoned a footman,
took his fur-coat, and followed Ivan Becker into the open.
The lackey hurried to the garage. In a few minutes the car
appeared. Christian permitted Ivan Michailovitch to precede
him into it, asked for the address, and sat down beside him.
The car started.</p>


<h3>XX</h3>

<p>Twice before this had Ivan Michailovitch visited the family
of the imprisoned workman, Roderick Kroll. His interest in
these people was not an immediate one. It had been evoked by
the interest he took in Christian Wahnschaffe. There was
something in Christian that moved him deeply. After their
first conversation he had at once reflected long concerning his
personality and his great charm, as well as concerning the
circumstances of his life and the social soil from which he had
sprung. And since the name of the industrial baron Wahnschaffe
had been so closely connected with the trial of Roderick
Kroll, and since that trial had made quite a stir in the world,
his attention had naturally been drawn in this direction. It
is possible that he had already weighed the step he was now
taking. For he was immovably convinced that many men
would be better, and deal more justly, if they could but be
brought to see, or given an opportunity to see, the realities of
the world.</p>

<p>Frau Kroll and her five children had found refuge in a mere
hole of a garret at the top of a populous tenement on the
extreme edge of the city. Before that she had inhabited one
of the numerous cottages for workingmen that Albrecht Wahnschaffe
had built near his factories. But she had been driven
from this home, and had moved to the city.</p>

<p>The room she now had gave shelter not only to herself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
her children, the oldest of whom was twelve, but to three
lodgers: a rag-picker, a hurdy-gurdy man, and a chronically
drunken vagabond. The room had a floor-space of sixty
square feet; the lodgers slept on dirty straw sacks, the children
on two ragged mattresses pushed close together, Frau Kroll
on a shawl and a bundle of old clothes in the corner where
the slanting ceiling met the floor.</p>

<p>On this particular day the agent of the landlord had appeared
three times to demand the rent. The third time, since
no money was forthcoming, he had threatened to evict them
all that night. Fifteen minutes before the arrival of Ivan
Becker and Christian he had appeared with the janitor and
another helper in the dim, evil-smelling room, and had proceeded
to make good his threat. His face had an expression
of good nature rather than of harshness. He was proud of the
touch of humour which he brought to the execution of his
duties. Cries and lamentations did not disturb him in the
least. He said: “Hurry, children! Come on there!” Or
else: “Shoulder your guns and march! Let’s have no scenes!
Don’t get excited! No use getting on your knees! Time is
money! Quick work is good work!”</p>

<p>As was usual on such occasions, a commotion stirred all the
neighbours, and they assembled in the hall. There was a
yellow-haired woman in her shift; there was one in a scarlet
dressing gown; there was a cripple without legs, an old man
with a long beard, children who were fighting one another, a
painted woman with a hat as large as a cart-wheel, another
with a burning candle in her hand, while a man who had just
come in from the street in her company sought to hide in the
darkness near the roof.</p>

<p>What one heard was the wailing of the Kroll children, and
the hard beseeching voice of the woman, who looked on with
desperate eyes as the agent and his men heaped up her poor
possessions. The vagabond cursed, the hurdy-gurdy man
dragged his straw sack toward the door, the agent snapped his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fingers and said: “Hurry, good people, hurry! Let’s have no
tender scenes! My supper is getting cold!”</p>


<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>Christian and Ivan Becker entered. They forced their way
through the staring crowd. Christian had on his costly fur-coat.
The agent stood still and his jaw dropped. His men
instinctively touched their caps. Ivan Michailovitch wanted to
close the door, but the woman in the big hat stood on the
threshold and would not stir. “The door should be closed,”
he said to the agent, who went forward and closed it, simply
thrusting the woman roughly back. Ivan asked whether the
woman and her children were to be evicted. The agent declared
that she was unable to pay her rent, that one extension
of time after another had been granted her, but that to continue
would be to create disorder and institute a bad example.
Ivan Michailovitch answered that he understood the situation.
Then he turned to Christian, and repeated the words as though
he needed to translate them into another tongue: “She cannot
pay her rent.” A whistle sounded from without, and a woman
screeched. The agent opened the door, cried out a command,
and slammed it again. Silence ensued.</p>

<p>Frau Kroll was crouching among her children, her elbows
dug into her lap. She had a robust figure, and a bony face
that was pale as dough and deeply furrowed. It looked like
the head of a corpse. The children looked at her in terror:
two were mother naked, and one of these had the itch. The
agent, assuming a benevolent tone, asked Ivan Becker whether
something was to be done for these people; he evidently did not
dare to address Christian. “I think we shall be able to do
something for them,” Ivan answered, and turned to Christian.</p>

<p>Christian heard and saw. He nodded rapidly, and gave an
impression of timidity and passionate zeal.</p>

<p>Christian’s attention somehow became fixed on a water jug
with a broken handle. The jug was stamped with a greenish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
pattern and the banal arabesques bit into his mind. The snow-edged,
slanting window in the roof troubled him, and the sight
of a single muddy boot. Next a sad fascination came to him
from a rope that dangled from the roof, and from a little
coal-oil lamp with a smoky chimney. His mere bodily vision
clung to these things. But they passed into his soul, and he
merged into oneness with them. He himself was that broken
jug with its green figures, the snow-edged window, the muddy
boot, the dangling rope, the smoky lamp. He was being transformed
as in a melting furnace, shape glided into shape; and
although he was objectively aware of what was taking place
and also of the people&mdash;the beggar, the woman, the children,
Ivan Michailovitch, the agent, and those who waited outside&mdash;yet
it cost him a passionate effort to keep them outside of
himself for yet a little while, until they should plunge down
upon his soul with their torment, despair, cruelty, and madness,
like wild dogs throwing themselves upon a bone.</p>

<p>A sigh escaped him; a disturbed and fleeting smile hovered
about his lips. One of the children, a boy of four, clad in a
shapeless rag, came to him, and gazed up at him as though he
were a tower. At once the eyes of the others were fixed on
him too. At least, he felt them. His breast seemed a fiery
crucible upborne and held high by the boy’s emaciated arms.
In a moment he had filled his hand with gold pieces, and by a
gesture encouraged the child to hold out its hands. He
poured the gold into them. But they could grasp only a few.
The coins rolled on the floor, and the people there watched
them in dumb amazement.</p>

<p>He drew out his wallet, took from it with trembling fingers
every bank note it held, looked about, and approached the
cowering woman. Then suddenly there seized him a strange
contempt for his own erectness while she crouched on the
floor. And so he kneeled, kneeled down beside her, and let
the notes slip into her lap. He did not know how much money
there was. But it was found later that the sum was four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
thousand six hundred marks. He arose and took Ivan’s arm,
and the latter understood his glance.</p>

<p>There was a breathless silence when they left. The agent
and his men, the lodgers, the children&mdash;all seemed turned to
stone. The woman stared at the wealth in her lap. Then she
uttered a loud cry and lost consciousness. The little boy played
with the pieces of gold, and they clinked as only gold can,
faintly sweet and without hardness.</p>

<p>Below, in the street, Ivan Michailovitch said to Christian:
“That you kneeled down before her&mdash;that was it, and that
alone! The gift&mdash;there was something fateful in it to me and
something bitter! But that you kneeled down beside her&mdash;ah,
that was it!” And with a sudden gesture he lifted himself
on his toes, and took Christian’s head between his hands, and
kissed him with a kiss that was a breath upon the forehead.
Then he murmured a word of farewell, and hurried down the
street without looking at the waiting car.</p>

<p>Christian ordered the chauffeur to drive out to Christian’s
Rest. Two hours later he was there, in deep quietude, the
quietude that he needed. He telephoned his family that unforeseen
events had prevented him from staying to the end of
the evening’s festivities, but that he would be present at the
ceremony of Judith’s marriage without fail. Then he retired
to the farthest room of his house, and held vigil all night.</p>


<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>Letitia married six weeks after Judith. At Stephen Gunderam’s
desire, however, the wedding was a quiet one. There
was a simple meal in a hotel at Heidelberg, and those present
were Frau von Febronius, the countess, their two nephews
Ottomar and Reinhold, and an Argentinian friend of Stephen’s&mdash;a
raw-boned giant who had been sent to Germany for a year
to acquire polish.</p>

<p>Ottomar recited an original poem in praise of his pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
cousin, and Reinhold had composed an address in the style
of Luther’s table-talk. Stephen Gunderam showed small appreciation
of the literary culture of his new kinsman.</p>

<p>Frau von Febronius was silent even at the moment of farewell.
The countess wept very copiously. She provided Letitia
with all manner of rules and admonitions, but the most difficult
of all she had delayed, out of sheer cowardice to the very
last. She drew Letitia into her own room and, blushing and
paling by turns, attempted to give the girl some notion of the
physiology of marriage. But her courage failed her even now,
and whenever she approached the real crux of her subject,
she began to stammer and grow confused. It amused Letitia
immensely.</p>

<p>Stephen Gunderam wanted to depart in haste, like some one
anxious to secure his booty.</p>

<p>Frau von Febronius said to her sister: “I have evil presentiments
in regard to this marriage, even though the child seems
quite happy. It is only her own nature that protects her
against unhappiness. It is her only dowry, but a wonderful
one.” Then the countess folded her hands, and shed tears,
and said: “If I have sinned, I pray God to forgive me.”</p>

<p>The voyage proved Letitia to be an excellent sailor. For a
few days she and her husband stopped in Buenos Ayres and
met many people. Stephen’s acquaintances regarded her with
sympathetic curiosity; and everything was strange and fascinating
to her&mdash;the people, the houses, animals, plants, the
very earth and sky. But most fascinating and strange to her
was still the jealous tyranny of the man she had married,
although at times the fascination held a touch of fear. But
when that assailed her, she jested even with herself, and drove
it away.</p>

<p>Early one morning there drew up a firmly built, heavy little
coach, with two small, swift horses, to carry them the thirty
miles to the Gunderam estate. Generously provisioned they
left the city. After a few hours the road ended as a brook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
is lost in sands, and before them stretched to the very horizon
the pathless plain of the pampas.</p>

<p>Yet they were not unguided. On either side of the way
which the horses had to travel, poles had been driven into the
grassy earth. These poles were of about human height, and
stood at intervals of about twenty yards. Thus the horses
pursued their way calmly. The Negro on the box had no
need to urge them on. The safe and monotonous journey
permitted him to sleep.</p>

<p>There were no settlements at all. When the horses needed
food or came upon water, a halt was made under the open
sky. No house, no tree, no human being appeared from sun
to sun, and a dread stole upon Letitia. She had long given up
talking, and Stephen had long given up encouraging her. He
slept like his coachman.</p>

<p>When the sun had sunk behind a veil of whitish clouds,
Letitia stood up, and gazed searchingly over the endless plain
of grass. The high wooden posts still projected with unwearying
regularity at both sides of the uncut road.</p>

<p>But suddenly she saw on one of the posts a greyish-brown
bird, moveless and bent, with huge, round, glowing eyes.</p>

<p>“What kind of a bird is that?” she asked.</p>

<p>Stephen Gunderam started from his slumber. “It’s an owl,”
he answered. “Have you never seen one? Every evening,
when darkness falls, they sit on the posts. Look, it is starting:
there is one on each.”</p>

<p>Letitia looked and saw that it was true. On every post and
on either side, far as one’s sight could reach, sat with its great,
circular, glowing eyes a heavy, slothful, solemn owl.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OR EVER THE SILVER CORD BE LOOSED</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fraulein von Einsiedel</span> took Crammon’s tender trifling
quite seriously. When Crammon observed this, he grew cold,
and planned at once to rid himself of the threatened complication.</p>

<p>She sent him urgent little notes by her maid; he left them
unanswered. She begged him for a meeting; he promised to
come but did not. She reproached him and inquired after the
reason. He cast down his eyes and answered sadly: “I was
mistaken in the hour, dear friend. For some time my mind
has been wandering. I sometimes wake in the morning and
fancy that it is still evening. I sit down at table and forget
to eat. I need treatment and shall consult a physician.
You must be indulgent, Elise.”</p>

<p>But Elise did not want to understand. According to Crammon’s
words of regretful deprecation, she belonged to the sort
of woman who makes a kiss or a tender meeting an excuse
for drawing all sorts of tiresome and impossible inferences.</p>

<p>He said to himself: “You must be robust of soul, Bernard,
and not permit your innate delicacy to make a weakling of
you. Here is a little trap for mice, and you can smell the
cheese from afar. She is pretty and good, but alas, quite blind
and deluded. As though a brief pleasure were not to be preferred
to a long wretchedness!”</p>

<p>To be prepared for any event, he packed his belongings.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Crammon had discovered where and in whose company
Christian had been on the night of the festival preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Judith’s wedding. The chauffeur had been indiscreet. Then
Crammon, in his brotherly concern, had made inquiries, and
the rumours that had reached the castle had all been confirmed.</p>

<p>One morning, when they were both at Christian’s Rest,
Crammon entered his friend’s room and said: “I can’t hold
in any longer. The sorrow of it gnaws at me. You ought to
be ashamed, Christian, especially of your secretiveness. You
join fugitive disturbers of the peace and hurlers of bombs, and
then you confuse the innocent poor by your brainless generosity.
What is it to lead to?”</p>

<p>Christian smiled, and did not answer.</p>

<p>“How can you expose yourself in that fashion,” Crammon
cried; “yourself and your family and your friends? I shall
tell you this in confidence, dearest boy: If you imagine that
you have really helped the woman to whom that Russian desperado
dragged you, you are badly mistaken. Fortunately I
can rob you of that illusion.”</p>

<p>“Did you hear anything about her?” Christian asked, with
a surprising indifference in his tone and expression.</p>

<p>Crammon seemed to expand, and told his tale with breadth
and unction: “Certainly I have. I have even had dealings
with the police and saved you annoyance. The woman was
to have been arrested and the money confiscated. Luckily
I was able to prevent that. I believe that the State should
keep order, but I don’t think it desirable that the government
should interfere in our private affairs. Its duty is to
safeguard us; there its function ends. So much for that! Concerning
your protégée I have nothing pleasant to report. The
rain of gold simply distracted the crowd in that house. They
stuck to her and begged, and several of them stole. Naturally
there was a fight, and some one plunged a knife into some one
else’s bowels, and the maddened woman beat them both with
a coal shovel. The police had to interfere. Then the woman
moved into other quarters, and bought all sorts of trash&mdash;furniture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
beds, clothing, kitchen utensils, and even a cuckoo
clock. You have seen those little horrors. A cuckoo comes
out of the clock and screams. I was once staying with people
who had three of them. Whenever I went to sleep another
cuckoo screeched; it was enough to drive one mad. In other
respects my friends were charming.</p>

<p>“As for the Kroll woman&mdash;your gift robbed her of every
vestige of common sense. She keeps the money in a little
box, which she carries about and won’t let out of her sight
by night or day. She buys lottery tickets, penny dreadfuls;
the children are as dirty as ever and the household as demoralized.
Only that dreadful cuckoo clock roars. So what have
you accomplished? Where is the blessing? Common people
cannot endure sudden accessions of fortune. You do not know
their nature in the slightest degree, and the best thing you can
do is to leave them in peace.”</p>

<p>Christian’s eyes wandered out to the cloudy sky. Then he
turned to Crammon. He saw, as though he had never seen
it before, that Crammon’s cheeks were rather fat, and that
his chin was bedded in soft flesh and had a dimple. He could
not make up his mind to answer. He smiled, and crossed
his legs!</p>

<p>What shapely legs, Crammon thought and sighed, what
superb legs!</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>A few days later Crammon appeared again with the intention
of testing Christian.</p>

<p>“I don’t like your condition, my dear boy,” he began, “and
I won’t pretend to you that I do. It’s just a week to-day that
we’ve been perishing of boredom here. I grant you it’s a
delightful place in spring and summer with agreeable companions,
when one can have picnics in the open and think of
the dull and seething cities. But now in the midst of winter,
without orgies or movement or women&mdash;what is the use of it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Why do you hide yourself? Why do you act depressed? What
are you waiting for? What have you in mind?”</p>

<p>“You ask so many questions, Bernard,” Christian replied.
“You should not do that. It is as well here as elsewhere.
Can you tell me any place where it is better?”</p>

<p>The last question aroused Crammon’s hopes. In the
expectation of common pleasures his face grew cheerful.
“A better place? My dearest boy, any compartment in
a train is better. The greasy reception room of Madame
Simchowitz in Mannheim is better. However, we shall
be able to agree. Here is an admirable plan. Palermo,
Conca d’Oro, Monte Pellegrino, and Sicilian girls with
avid glances behind their virtuous veils. From there
we shall take a flying trip to Naples to see my sweet little
friend Yvonne. She has the blackest hair, the whitest teeth,
and the most exquisite little feet in Europe. The regions
between are&mdash;sublime. Then we can send a telegram to Prosper
Madruzzi, who is nursing his spleen in his Venetian villa,
and let him introduce us into the most inaccessible circles of
Roman society. There one has dealings exclusively with
contessas, marchesas, and principessas. The striking characters
of all five continents swarm there as in a fascinating mad-house;
cold-blooded American women commit indiscretions
with passionate lazzaroni, who have magical names and impossible
silk socks; every kennel there can claim to be a curiosity,
every heap of stones adds to your culture, at every step you
stumble over some masterpiece of art.”</p>

<p>Christian shook his head. “It doesn’t tempt me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll propose something else,” Crammon said. “Go
with me to Vienna. It is a city worthy of your interest. Have
you ever heard of the Messiah? The Messiah is a person at
whose coming the Jews believe time will come to an end, and
whom they expect to welcome with the sound of shawms and
cymbals. It is thus that every distinguished stranger is greeted
in Vienna. If you cultivate an air of mystery, and are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
too stingy in the matter of tipping, and occasionally snub
some one who is unduly familiar&mdash;all Viennese society will be
at your feet. A pleasant moral slackness rules the city.
Everything that is forbidden is permitted. The women are
simply <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors concours</i>; the broiled meat at Sacher is incomparable;
the waltzes which you hear whenever a musician
takes up a fiddle are thrilling; a trip to the Little House
of Delight&mdash;name to be taken literally, please&mdash;is a dream.
I yearn for it all myself&mdash;the ingratiating air, the roast chicken,
the apple-pudding with whipped cream, and my own little hut
full of furniture of the age of Maria Theresa, and my two dear,
old ladies. Pull yourself together, and come with me.”</p>

<p>Christian shook his head. “It is nothing for me,” he said.</p>

<p>A flush of indignation spread over Crammon’s face. “Nothing
for you? Very well. I cannot place the harem of the
Sultan at your disposal, nor the gardens promised by the
Prophet. I shall leave you to your fate, and wander out into
the world.”</p>

<p>Christian laughed, for he did not believe him. On the next
day, however, Crammon said farewell with every sign of deep
grief, and departed.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Christian remained at his country house. A heavy snow-fall
came, and the year drew toward its end.</p>

<p>He received no visitors. He answered neither the letters
nor the invitations of his friends. He was to have spent Christmas
with his parents at the castle, but he begged them to
excuse him.</p>

<p>Since he was of age, Christian’s Rest had now passed fully
into his possession, and all his objects of art were gathered
here&mdash;statuary, pictures, miniatures, and his collection of snuff-boxes.
He loved these little boxes very much.</p>

<p>The dealers sent him their catalogues. He had a trusted
agent at every notable auction sale. To this man he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
telegraph his orders, and the things would arrive&mdash;a beaker
of mountain crystal, a set of Dresden porcelains, a charcoal
sketch by Van Gogh. But when he looked at his purchases,
he was disappointed. They seemed neither as rare nor as
precious as he had hoped.</p>

<p>He bought a sixteenth century Bible, printed on parchment,
with mani-coloured initials and a cover with silver clasps.
It had cost him fourteen thousand marks, and contained the
book-plate of the Elector Augustus of Saxony. Curiously he
turned the pages without regarding the words, which were
alien and meaningless to him. Nothing delighted him but his
consciousness of the rarity and preciousness of the volume.
But he desired other things even rarer and more precious.</p>

<p>Every morning he fed the birds. With a little basket of
bread crumbs he would issue from the door, and the birds
would fly to him from all directions, for they had come to
know both him and the hour. They were hungry, and he
watched them busy at their little meal. And doing this he
forgot his desires.</p>

<p>Once he donned his shooting suit, and went out and shot
a hare. When the animal lay before him, and he saw its
dying eyes, he could not bear to touch it. He who had hunted
and killed many animals could no longer endure this sport,
and left his booty a prey to the ravens.</p>

<p>Most of his walks led him through the village, which was
but fifteen minutes from his park. At the end of the village,
on the high-road, stood the forester’s house. Several times
he had noticed at one of its windows the face of a young man,
whose features he seemed to recall. He thought it must be
Amadeus Voss, the forester’s son. When he was but six he had
often visited that house. Christian’s Rest had not been built
until later, and in those early years his father had rented the
game preserve here and had often lodged for some days
at the forester’s. And Amadeus had been Christian’s playmate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The face, which recalled his childhood to him, was pallid and
hollow-cheeked. The lips were thin and straight, and the
head covered with simple very light blond hair. The reflection
of the light’s rays in the powerful lenses of spectacles made
the face seem eyeless.</p>

<p>It amazed Christian that this young man should sit there
for hours, day after day, without moving, and gaze through the
window-panes into the street. The secret he felt here stirred
him, and a power from some depth seemed to reach out for
him.</p>

<p>One day Christian met the mayor of the village at the
gate of his park. Christian stopped him. “Tell me,” he said,
“is the forester Voss still alive?”</p>

<p>“No, he died three years ago,” the man answered. “But
his widow still lives in the house. The present forester is
unmarried, and lets her have a few rooms. I suppose you are
asking on account of Amadeus, who has suddenly turned up
for some strange reason&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tell me about him,” Christian asked.</p>

<p>“He was to have been a priest, and was sent to the seminary
at Bamberg. One heard nothing but good of him there, and
his teachers praised him to the sky. He got stipends and scholarships,
and every one expected him to do well for himself.
Last winter his superiors got him a position as tutor to
the boys of the bank president, Privy Councillor Ribbeck.
You’re familiar with the name. Very big man. The two boys
whose education Voss was to supervise lived at Halbertsroda,
an estate in Upper Franconia, and the parents didn’t visit them
very often. They say the marriage isn’t a happy one. Well,
everything seemed turning out well. Considering his gifts and
the patron he had now, Amadeus couldn’t have wanted for
anything. Suddenly he drops down on us here, doesn’t budge
from the house, pays no attention to any one, becomes a burden
to his poor old mother, and growls like a dog at any one who
talks to him. There must have been crazy doings at Halberts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>roda.
No one knows any details, you know. But every now
and then the pot seethes over, and then you get the rumour that
there was something between him and the Privy Councillor’s
wife.”</p>

<p>The man was very talkative, and Christian interrupted him
at last. “Didn’t the forester have another son?” A faint
memory of some experience of his childhood arose in
him.</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said the mayor. “There was another son.
His name was Dietrich, and he was a deaf-mute.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember now,” Christian said.</p>

<p>“He died at fourteen,” the mayor went on. “His death was
never properly explained. There was a celebration of the
anniversary of the battle of Sedan, and he went out in the
evening to look at the bonfires. Next morning they found his
body in the fish-pond.”</p>

<p>“Did he drown?”</p>

<p>“He must have,” answered the mayor.</p>

<p>Christian nodded farewell, and went slowly through the gate
toward his house.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Letitia and her husband were in the Opera house at Buenos
Ayres. The operetta of the evening was as shallow as a puddle
left by the rain in the pampas.</p>

<p>In the box next to theirs sat a young man, and Letitia
yielded now and then to the temptation of observing his glances
of admiration. Suddenly she felt her arm roughly grasped.
It was Stephen who commanded her silently to follow him.</p>

<p>In the dim corridor he brought his bluish-white face close
to her ear, and hissed: “If you look at that fool once more,
I’ll plunge my dagger into your heart. I give you this warning.
In this country one doesn’t shilly-shally.”</p>

<p>They returned to their box. Stephen smiled with a smile
as glittering as a torero’s, and put a piece of chocolate into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
his mouth. Letitia looked at him sidewise, and wondered
whether he really had a dagger in his possession.</p>

<p>That night, when they drove home, he almost smothered
her with his caresses. She repulsed him gently, and begged:
“Show me the dagger, Stephen. Give it to me! I want so
much to see it.”</p>

<p>“What dagger, silly child?” he asked, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“The dagger you were going to plunge into my heart.”</p>

<p>“Let that be,” he answered, in hollow tones. “This is no
time to speak of daggers and death.”</p>

<p>But Letitia was stubborn. She insisted that she wanted to
see it. He took his hands from her, and fell into sombre
silence.</p>

<p>The incident taught Letitia that she could play with him.
She no longer feared that sombre stillness of his, nor his great
skull on his powerful neck, nor the thin mouth, nor the paling
face, nor the great strength of his extraordinary small hands.
She knew that she could play with him.</p>

<p>Great fire-flies flew through the air, and settled in the grass
about them. When the carriage stopped at the villa, Letitia
looked around with a cry of delight. Sparks seemed to be falling
in a golden rain. The gleaming insects whirred about the
windows, the roof, the flowery creepers on the walls. They
penetrated into the hall.</p>

<p>Letitia stopped at the dark foot of the stairs, looked at the
phosphorescent glimmer, and asked fearfully and with an
almost imperceptible self-mockery in her deep voice: “Tell
me, Stephen, couldn’t they set the house on fire?”</p>

<p>The Negro Scipio, who appeared with a lamp at the door,
heard her words and grinned.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Around Twelfth Night Randolph von Stettner with several
friends came to Christian’s Rest. The young men had called
up Christian by telephone, and he had been alone so long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
that he was glad to receive them and be their host. He was
always glad to see Randolph. The latter brought with him
two comrades, a Baron Forbach and a Captain von Griesingen,
and also another friend, a young university teacher, who was
fulfilling his required military service at Bonn and was therefore
also in uniform. Christian had met him before at a celebration
of the Borussia fraternity.</p>

<p>A delicious meal was served, followed by excellent cigars
and liqueurs.</p>

<p>“It is consoling to see that you still don’t despise the comforts
of the flesh,” Randolph von Stettner said to Christian.</p>

<p>Captain von Griesingen sighed: “How should one despise
them? They torment us and they flit temptingly about us!
Think of all that is desirable in the world&mdash;women, horses,
wine, power, fame, money, love! There is a dealer of jewels
in Frankfort, named David Markuse, who has a diamond
that is said to be worth half a million. I have no desire for
that special object. But the world is full of things that are
possessed and give delight.”</p>

<p>“It is the diamond known as Ignifer,” Dr. Leonrod remarked,
“a sort of adventurer among precious stones.”</p>

<p>“Ignifer is an appropriate name for a diamond,” said Randolph.
“But why do you speak of it so gravely? What, except
its price, makes it differ from other stones? Has it had so
strange a fate?”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” said Dr. Leonrod, “most strange. I happen
to know the details because, as a professional mineralogist,
I take a certain interest in precious stones, too.”</p>

<p>“Do tell us about it!” the young officers cried.</p>

<p>“Whoever buys Ignifer,” Dr. Leonrod began, “will show no
little courage. The jewel is a tragic thing. It has been proved
that its first owner was Madame de Montespan. No sooner
did it come into her possession than the king dismissed her.
Marie Antoinette owned it next. It weighed ninety-five carats
at that time. But during the Revolution it was stolen and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
divided, and did not reappear until fifty years later. The
recovered stone weighed sixty carats. An Englishman, named
Thomas Horst, bought it, and was soon murdered. The heirs
sold it to an American. The lady who wore it, a Mrs. Malmcote,
was throttled by a madman at a ball. Then Prince
Alexander Tshernitsheff brought it to Russia, and gave it to
an actress who was his mistress. Another lover shot and killed
her on the stage. The prince was blown to pieces by a nihilist.
Then the stone was brought to Paris, and purchased by the
Sultan Abdul Hamid for his favourite wife. The woman was
poisoned, and you all know what happened to the Sultan.
After the Turkish Revolution Ignifer drifted West again, and
then back to the Orient. For its new owner, Tavernier,
took a voyage to India, and was shipwrecked and drowned.
For a time it was thought that the diamond was lost. But
that was an error; it had been deposited in a safety vault in
a Calcutta bank. Now it is back in Europe, and for sale.”</p>

<p>“The stone must harbour an evil spirit,” said Randolph.
“I confess that I have no desire for it. I am very little
inclined to superstition; but when the facts are as compelling
as in this case, the most enlightened scepticism seems rebuked.”</p>

<p>“What does all that matter if the stone is beautiful, if it
really is incomparably lovely?” Christian cried, with a defiant
look, that yet seemed turned inward upon his soul. After this
he said little, even when the conversation drifted to other
subjects.</p>

<p>Next day at noon he ordered his car and drove in to Frankfort
to the shop of the jeweller David Markuse.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Herr Markuse knew Christian.</p>

<p>Ignifer was kept in the safe of a fire-proof and burglar-proof
vault. Herr Markuse lifted the stone out of its case, laid it
upon the green cloth of a table, stepped aside, and looked at
Christian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian looked silently at the concentrated radiance of the
stone. His thought was: This is the rarest and costliest thing
in the world; nothing can surpass it. And it was immediately
clear to him that he must own the jewel.</p>

<p>The diamond had the faintest tinge of yellow. It had
been cut so that it had many rich facets. A little groove
had been cut into it near one end, so that a woman could
wear it around her neck by a thin chain or a silken
cord.</p>

<p>Herr Markuse lifted it upon a sheet of white paper and
breathed upon it. “It is not of the first water,” he said,
“but it has neither rust nor knots. There is no trace of veins
or cracks, no cloudiness or nodules. Not a flaw. The stone
is one of nature’s miracles.”</p>

<p>The price was five hundred and fifty thousand marks. Christian
offered the half million. Herr Markuse consulted his
watch. “I promised a lady that I would hold it,” he declared.
“But the promised hour is past.” They agreed upon five hundred
and twenty thousand marks. Half was to be paid in
cash, the other in two notes running for different periods.
“The name of Wahnschaffe is sufficient guarantee,” the merchant
said.</p>

<p>Christian weighed the diamond in his hand, and laid it
down again.</p>

<p>David Markuse smiled. “In my business one learns how
to judge people,” he said without any familiarity. “You are
making this purchase with a deeper intention than you yourself
are probably conscious of. The soul of the diamond has lured
you on. For the diamond has a soul.”</p>

<p>“Do you really mean that?” Christian was surprised.</p>

<p>“I know it. There are people who lose all shame when
they see a beautiful jewel. Their nostrils quiver, their cheeks
grow pale, their hands tremble uncertainly, their pupils expand,
and they betray themselves by every motion. Others are
intimidated, or bereft of their senses, or saddened. You gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
curious insights into human nature. The masks drop. Diamonds
make people transparent.”</p>

<p>The indiscreet turn of the conversation irritated Christian.
But he had often before become aware of the fact that something
in him seemed to invite the communicativeness and confidence
of others. He arose, and promised to return that
evening.</p>

<p>“The lady of whom I was speaking,” Markuse continued,
as he accompanied him to the door, “and who was here yesterday,
is a very wonderful lady. When she came in, I thought:
is it possible for mere walking to be so beautiful? Well, I soon
found out that she is a famous dancer. She is stopping at the
Palace Hotel for a day, on her way from Paris to Russia,
merely in order to see Ignifer. I showed her the stone. She
stood looking at it for at least five minutes. She did not move,
and the expression of her face! Well, if the jewel didn’t represent
a large part of all I have in the world, I would have begged
her simply to keep it. Such moments are not exactly frequent
in my business. She was to have returned to-day, but, as I
have told you, she didn’t keep her engagement.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know her name?” Christian asked, shyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Her name is Eva Sorel. Did you ever hear of
her?”</p>

<p>The blood came into Christian’s face. He let go the knob
of the door. “Eva Sorel is here?” he murmured. He pulled
himself together, and opened the door to an empty room
that was carpeted in red, and the walls of which were hidden
by ebony cases. Almost at the same moment the opposite door
was thrown open; and, followed by four gentlemen, Eva Sorel
crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>Christian stood perfectly still.</p>

<p>“Eidolon!” Eva cried, and she folded her hands in that
inimitably enthusiastic and happy gesture of hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Christian did not know the gentlemen who were with her.
Their features and garments showed them to be foreigners.
Accustomed to surprising events in Eva’s daily life, they
regarded Christian with cool curiosity.</p>

<p>Eva’s whole form was wrapped in a grey mole-skin coat.
Her fur cap was trimmed with an aigrette of herons’ feathers,
held by a marvellous ruby clasp. From under the cap her
honey-coloured hair struggled forth. The wintry air had given
her skin an exquisite delicate tinge of pink.</p>

<p>With a few steps she came stormily to Christian, and her
white gloved hands sought both of his. Her great and flaming
looks drove his conscious joy and his perceptions of her presence
back upon his soul, and fear appeared upon his features.
He found himself as defenceless as a ball flung by another’s
hand. He awaited his goal.</p>

<p>“Did you buy Ignifer?” That was her first question. Since
he was silent, she turned with raised brows to David Markuse.</p>

<p>The merchant bowed and said: “I thought that I could no
longer count on you, Madame. I am sorry with all my heart.”</p>

<p>“You are right. I hesitated too long.” Eva spoke her
melodious German, with its slightly foreign intonation. Turning
to Christian she went on: “Perhaps it makes no difference,
Eidolon, whether you have it or I. It is like a heart that
ambition has turned to crystal. But you are not ambitious.
If you were, we should have met here like two birds swept
by a storm into the same cave. The preciousness of the stone
almost makes it ghostly to me, and I would permit no one to
give it to me who was not conscious of its significance. And
who is there? What do they give one? Wares from a shop,
that is all.”</p>

<p>David Markuse looked at her in admiration, and nodded.</p>

<p>“It is said to bring misfortune to its possessors,” Christian
almost whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you intend to test yourself, Eidolon, and put it to the
proof? Will you challenge the demon to prevail against you?
Ah, that is what allured me, too. Its name made me envious.
As I held it, it seemed like the navel of Buddha, from which
one cannot divert one’s thought, if one has once seen it.”</p>

<p>She noticed that the people about them seemed to make
Christian hesitate, so she took his arm, and drew him behind
the curtains of a window-niche.</p>

<p>“That it brings misfortune to people is certain,” Christian
repeated mechanically. “How can I keep it, Eva, since you
desired it?”</p>

<p>“Keep it and break the evil spell,” Eva answered, and
laughed. But his seriousness remained unchanged; and she
apologized for her laughter by a gesture, as though she were
throwing aside the undue lightness of her mood. She watched
him silently. In the sharp light reflected from the snow, her
eyes were green as malachite. “What are you doing with
yourself?” she asked. “Your eyes look lonesome.”</p>

<p>“I have been living rather alone for some time,” answered
Christian. His utterances were dry and precise. “Crammon
too has left me.”</p>

<p>“Ivan Becker wrote me about you,” Eva said in muffled
tones. “I kissed the letter. I carried it in my bosom, and
said the words of it over to myself. Is there such a thing as
an awakening? Can the soul emerge from the darkness, as a
flower does from the bulb? But there you stand in your pride,
and do not move. Speak! Our time is short.”</p>

<p>“Why speak at all?”</p>

<p>Although his eyes seemed so unseeing, it did not escape him
that Eva’s face had changed. A new severity was on it, and
a heightened will controlled its nerves, even to the raising and
lowering of her long lashes. Experience of men and things
had lent it an austere radiance, and her unbounded mastery
over them a breath of grandeur.</p>

<p>“I had not forgotten that this is the city where you dwell,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
she said, “but in these driven hours there was no place for
you. They count my steps, and lie in wait for the end of my
sleeping. What I should have is either a prison or a friend
unselfish enough to force me to be more frugal of myself. In
Lisbon the queen gave me a beautiful big dog, who was so
devoted to me that I felt it in my very body. A week later
he was found poisoned at the gate of the garden. I could have
put on mourning for him. How silent and watchful he was,
and how he could love!” She raised her shoulders with a little
shiver, dropped them again, and continued with hurry in her
voice. “I shall summon you some day. Will you come? Will
you be ready?”</p>

<p>“I shall come,” Christian answered very simply, but his
heart throbbed.</p>

<p>“Is your feeling for me the same&mdash;changeless and unchangeable?”
In her look there was an indescribably lyrical lift,
and her body, moved by its spirit, seemed to emerge from
veils.</p>

<p>He only bowed his head.</p>

<p>“And how is it in the matter of <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cortesia</i>?” She came nearer
to him, so that he felt her breath on his lips. “He smiles,”
she exclaimed, and her lips opened, showing her teeth, “instead
of just once throwing himself on his knees in rage or jubilation&mdash;he
smiles. Take care, you with your smile, that I am not
tempted to extinguish your smiling some day.” She stripped
the glove from her right hand, and gave the naked hand to
Christian, who touched it with his lips. “It is a compact,
Eidolon,” she said serenely now, and with an air of seduction,
“and you will be ready.” Emerging from the niche, she turned
to the gentlemen who had come with her, and who had been
holding whispered conversations: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Messieurs, nous sommes
bien pressés</span>.”</p>

<p>She inclined her head to the jeweller, and the heron feathers
trembled. The four gentlemen let her precede them swiftly,
and followed her silently and reverently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>When next Christian went through the village and saw
Amadeus Voss at the window, he stopped.</p>

<p>Voss got up suddenly and opened the window, and thereupon
Christian approached.</p>

<p>It was a time of thaw. The water dripped from the roofs
and gutters. Christian felt the moist air swept by tepid winds
as something that gives pain.</p>

<p>Behind the powerful lenses the eyes of Amadeus Voss had a
yellowish glitter. “We must be old acquaintances,” he said,
“although it is very long ago since we hunted blackberries
among the hedges. Very long.” He laughed a little weakly.</p>

<p>Christian had determined to lead the conversation to the
dead brother of Amadeus. There was that event in the mist
of the past concerning which he could gain no clearness, much
as he might reflect.</p>

<p>“I suppose everybody is wondering about me,” Voss said,
in the tone of one who would like to know what people are
saying. “I seem to be a stumbling-block to them. Don’t
you think so?”</p>

<p>“I mustn’t presume to judge,” Christian said, guardedly.</p>

<p>“With what an expression you say that!” Voss murmured,
and looked Christian all over. “How proud you are. Yet it
must have been curiosity that made you stop.”</p>

<p>Christian shrugged his shoulders. “Do you remember an
incident that took place when I stayed here with my father?”
he asked gently and courteously.</p>

<p>“What kind of an incident? I don’t know. Or&mdash;but wait!
Do you mean that affair of the pig? When they killed the
pig over there in the inn, and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Quite right. That was it,” Christian said with a faint
smile. He had scarcely spoken when the scene and the incident
appeared with unwonted clarity before his mind.</p>

<p>He and Amadeus and the deaf and dumb Dietrich had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
standing at the gate. And the pig had begun to scream. At
that moment Amadeus had stretched out his arms, and held
them convulsively trembling in the air. The long, loud, and
piercing cry of the beast’s death agony had been something
new and dreadful to Christian too, and had drawn him running
to the spot whence it came. He saw the gleaming knife, the
uplifted and then descending arm of the butcher, the struggle
of the short, bristly legs, and the quivering and writhing of the
victim’s body. The lips of Amadeus, who had reeled after
him, had been flecked with foam, and he pointed and moaned:
“Blood, blood!” And Christian had seen the blood on the
earth, on the knife, on the white apron of the man. He did
not know what happened next. But Amadeus knew.</p>

<p>He said: “When the pig screamed, a convulsive rigour fell
upon me. For many hours I lay stiff as a log. My parents
were badly frightened, for I had never had any such attacks
before. What you remember is probably how they tried to
cheer me or shame me out of my collapse. They walked into
the puddle of blood and stamped about in it so that the blood
spurted. My dumb brother noticed that this only increased
my excitement. He made noises in his throat, and raised his
hands beseechingly, while my mother was hastening from the
house. At that moment you struck him in the face with your
fist.”</p>

<p>“It is true. I struck him,” said Christian, and his face
became very pale.</p>

<p>“And why? Why did you do that? We haven’t met since
that day, and we’ve only seen each other from afar. That is,
I’ve seen you. You were far too proud and too busy with your
friends to see me. But why did you strike Dietrich that day?
He had a sort of silent adoration of you. He followed you
about everywhere. Don’t you remember? We often laughed
about it. But from that day on he was changed&mdash;markedly
so.”</p>

<p>“I believe I hated him at that moment,” Christian said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
reflectively. “I hated him because he could neither hear nor
speak. It struck me as a sort of malevolent stubbornness.”</p>

<p>“Strange! It’s strange that you should have felt so.”</p>

<p>They both became silent. Christian started to leave. Voss
rested his arms on the window ledge and leaned far out.
“There’s a paragraph in the paper saying that you’ve bought
a diamond for half a million. Is that true?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” Christian replied.</p>

<p>“A single diamond for over half a million? I thought it
was merely a newspaper yarn. Is the diamond to be seen?
Would you show it to me?” In his face there was something
of horrified revolt, of panting desire, but also of mockery.
Christian was startled.</p>

<p>“With pleasure, if you’ll come to see me,” he answered, but
determined to have himself denied to Voss if the latter really
came.</p>

<p>For a secret stirred him again, a depth opened at his feet,
an arm was stretched out after him.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>On a certain night Letitia awoke and heard dragging, running
steps, the breathing of pursuers and pursued, whispers
and hoarse curses, now nearer, now farther. She sat up and
listened. Her bed-chamber opened upon gardens. Its doors
led to the verandah that surrounded the entire house.</p>

<p>Then the hurrying steps approached; she saw forms that
detached themselves in black from the greenish night and flitted
by: one, and then another, and then a third, and after
a little while a fourth. She was frightened, but she hated to
call for help. To rouse Stephen, who slept in the adjoining
room, was a risk for her, as it was for every one. At such times
he would roar like a steer, and strike out wildly.</p>

<p>Letitia laughed and shuddered at the thought.</p>

<p>She fought her fear, got up, threw on a dressing gown, and
stepped determinedly on the verandah. At that moment thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
clouds parted and revealed the moon. Surprised by the unexpected
light, the four forms stopped suddenly, collided against
each other, and stood panting and staring.</p>

<p>What Letitia saw was old Gottlieb Gunderam and his three
sons, Riccardo, Paolo, and Demetrios, the brothers of her husband.
There was an unquenchable distrust between this
father and his sons. They watched and lay in wait for each
other. If there was cash in the house, the old man did not
dare go to bed, and each of the brothers accused the rest of
wanting to rob their father. Letitia knew that much. But it
was new to her that in their dumb rage and malice they went
so far as to chase each other at night, each pursuer and pursued
at once, each full of hatred of the one in front and full of terror
of the one behind him. She laughed and shuddered.</p>

<p>The old man was the first to slink away. He dragged himself
to his room, and threw himself on the bed in his clothes.
Beside the bed stood two huge travelling boxes, packed and
locked. They had stood thus for twenty years. Daily, during
all that period, he had determined at least once to flee to the
house in Buenos Ayres, or even to the United States, whenever
the conflict, first with his wife and later with his sons,
became too much for him. He had never started on that flight;
but the boxes stood in readiness.</p>

<p>Silently and secretively the brothers also disappeared. While
Letitia stood on the verandah and looked at the moon, she
heard the rattle of a phonograph. Riccardo had recently
bought it in the city, and it often happened that he set it to
playing at night.</p>

<p>Letitia stepped a little farther, and peered into the room
in which the three brothers sat with sombre faces and played
poker. The phonograph roared a vulgar waltz out of its brazen
throat.</p>

<p>Then Letitia laughed and shuddered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Christian wondered whether Amadeus would come. Two
days passed in slightly depressing suspense.</p>

<p>He had really intended to go to Waldleiningen to look after
his horses. Sometimes he could actually see their spirited yet
gentle eyes, their velvet coats, and that fine nervousness that
vibrated between dignity and restiveness. He recalled with
pleasure the very odour of the stables.</p>

<p>The pure bred Scotch horse which he had bought of Denis
Lay was to run in the spring races. His grooms told him that
the beautiful animal had been in poor form for some weeks,
and he thought that perhaps it missed his tender hand. Nevertheless
he did not go to Waldleiningen.</p>

<p>On the third day Amadeus Voss sent a gardener to ask
whether he might call that evening. Instead Christian went
down to the forester’s house that afternoon at four, and
knocked at the door.</p>

<p>Voss looked at him suspiciously. With the instinct of the
oppressed classes he divined the fact that Christian wanted to
keep him from his house. But Christian was far from being
as clear about his own motives as Amadeus suspected. He
scented a danger. Some magic in it drew him on half-consciously
to go forth to meet it.</p>

<p>Looking about in the plain but clean and orderly room
Christian saw on the tinted wall above the bed white slips of
paper on which verses of Scripture had been copied in a large
hand. One was this: “He was led as a sheep to the slaughter;
and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his
mouth.” And another was this: “For it is a day of trouble,
and of treading down, and of perplexity by the Lord God of
hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the walls, and
of crying to the mountains.” And this other: “The Lord said
unto me, Within a year, within the years of an hireling, and
all the glory of Kedar shall fail.” And finally there was this:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
“I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I
would thou were cold or hot. So then because thou art
lukewarm, and neither cold or hot, I will spue thee out of my
mouth.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Christian looked at Amadeus Voss long and curiously. Then
he asked, in a very careful voice, and yet not without an
inevitable tinge of worldly mockery: “Are you very religious?”</p>

<p>Amadeus frowned and answered: “Whether I answer one
way or the other it will mean equally little to you. Did you
come to cross-question me? Have we anything in common that
an answer to that question could reveal? Amadeus Voss and
Christian Wahnschaffe&mdash;are those not the names of sundered
poles? What image is there that could express the differences
that divide us? Your faith and mine! And such things are
possible on the same earth!”</p>

<p>“Was your youth especially hard?” Christian asked, innocently.</p>

<p>Voss gave a short laugh, and looked at Christian sidewise.
“D’you know what meal days are? Of course you don’t.
Well, on such days you get your meals at strangers’ houses
who feed you out of charity. Each day of the week you’re
with another family. Each week repeats the last. Not to be
thought ungrateful you must be obedient and modest. Even
if your stomach revolts at some dish, you must pretend it’s
a delicacy. If the grandfather laughs, you must laugh too; if
an uncle thinks he’s a wit, you must grin. If the daughter of
the house chooses to be insolent, you must be silent. If they
respond to your greeting, it’s a great favour; the worn overcoat
with ragged lining they gave you when winter came binds
you in eternal gratitude. You come to know all the black
moods of all these people with whom you sit at table, all their
shop-worn opinions, their phrases and hypocritical expressions;
and for the necessary hour of each day you must learn to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
practise its special kind of dissembling. That is the meaning
of meal days.”</p>

<p>He got up, walked to and fro, and resumed his seat. “The
devil appeared to me early,” he said in a hollow voice. “Perhaps
I took a certain experience of my childhood more
grievously to heart than others, perhaps the poison of it filtered
deeper into me. But you cannot forget. It is graven upon
my soul that my drunken father beat my mother. He did it
every Saturday night with religious regularity. That image
is not to be obliterated.”</p>

<p>Christian did not take his eyes from the face of Amadeus.</p>

<p>Softly, and with a rigid glance, Voss continued: “One night
before Easter, when I was eight years old, he beat her again.
I rushed into the yard, and cried out to the neighbours for
help. Then I looked up at the window, and I saw my mother
stand there wringing her hands in despair. And she was
naked.” And his voice almost died into silence as he added:
“Who is it that dare see his own mother naked?”</p>

<p>Again he arose and wandered about the room. He was so
full of himself that his speech seemed indeed addressed to himself
alone. “Two things there are that made me reflect and
wonder even in my childhood. First, the very many poor
creatures, whom my father reported because they stole a little
wood, and who were put in prison. I often heard some poor,
little old woman or some ragged half-starved lad beg for
mercy. There was no mercy here. My father was the forester,
and had to do his duty. Secondly, there were the many rich
people who live in this part of the country in their castles, on
their estates, in their hunting-lodges, and to whom nothing is
denied that their wildest impulses demand. Between the two
one stands as between two great revolving cylinders of steel.
One is sure to be crushed to bits in the end.”</p>

<p>For a while he gazed into emptiness. “What is your opinion
of an informer?” he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian answered with a forced smile: “It’s not a good
one.”</p>

<p>“Listen to me. In the seminary I had a fellow-student
named Dippel. His gifts were moderate, but he was a decent
chap and a hard worker. His father was a signalman on the
railroad&mdash;one of the very poor, and his son was his one hope
and pride. Dippel happened to be acquainted with a painter
in whose studio he came across an album of photographs displaying
the female form in plastic poses. The adolescent boy
gazed at them again and again, and finally begged the painter
to lend him the album. Dippel slept in my dormitory. I was
monitor, and I soon observed the crowding and the sensuous
atmosphere about Dippel, who had shown the pictures to a
few friends. It was like a spreading wound. I went into the
matter and ruthlessly confiscated the pictures. I informed the
faculty. Dippel was summoned, sternly examined, and
expelled. Next day we found him swinging dead from the
apple tree.”</p>

<p>Christian’s face flushed hotly. The tone of equanimity with
which it was recited was more repulsive than the story itself.</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss continued: “You think that was a contemptible
action. But according to the principles that had been
impressed on us I was merely doing my duty. I was sixteen;
and I seemed to be, and was, in a dark hole. I needed to get
out to the air and light. I was like one squeezed in by a great
throng, who cannot see what happens beyond. The fumes of
impatience throttled me, and everything in me cried out for
space and light. It was like living on the eternally dark side
of the moon. I was afraid of the might of evil; and all that I
heard of men was more or less evil. The scales rose and fell
in my breast. There are hours in which one can either become
a murderer or die on the cross. I yearned for the world. Yet I
prayed much in those days, and read many books of devotion,
and practised cruel penances. Late at night, when all others
slept, a priest found me absorbed in prayer with the hair-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>shirt
about my body. During mass or choral singing an incomparable
and passionate devotion streamed through me. But
then again I saw flags in the streets of the city, or well-dressed
women, or I stood in the railway station, and a train of
luxurious cars seemed to mock me. Or I saw a man who had
hurled himself out of a window and whose brains spattered the
pavement, and he seemed to cry out to me: Brother, brother!
Then the evil one arose in bodily form and I desired to clutch
him. Yes, evil has bodily form and only evil&mdash;injustice,
stupidity, lying, all the things that are repulsive to one to the
very core, but which one must embrace and be, if one has not
been born with a silver spoon in one’s mouth. To save a ray
of light for myself, I learned to play the organ. It helped
little. What does music matter, or poems or beautiful pictures,
or noble buildings, or books of philosophy, or the whole magnificent
world without? I cannot reach myself. Between
me and that real self there is something&mdash;what is it? A wall
of red-hot glass. Some are accursed from the beginning. If I
ask: how could the curse be broken? there is but one answer:
the monstrous would need to come to pass, the unimaginable!
Thus it is with me.”</p>

<p>Christian was shocked. “What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“One would have to gain a new experience,” answered
Amadeus Voss, “to know a being truly human&mdash;in the highest
and deepest sense.” In the gathering dusk his face had the
hue of stone. It was a well-shaped face&mdash;long, narrow, intelligent,
full of impassioned suffering. The lenses in front of
his eyes sparkled in the last light of day, and on his fair hair
was a glimmer as upon jewels.</p>

<p>“Are you going to stay in the village?” Christian inquired,
not from a desire to know, but out of the distress which he
felt in the heavy silence. “You were employed by Councillor
Ribbeck. Will you return to him?”</p>

<p>Voss’s nerves twitched. “Return? There is no return,” he
murmured. “Do you know Ribbeck? Well, I hardly know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
him myself. I saw him just twice. The first time was when
he came to the seminary to engage a tutor for his sons. When
I think of him I have the image of something fat and frozen.
I was picked out at once. My superiors approved of me highly
and desired to smooth my path. Yes. And I saw him for the
second time one night in December, when he appeared at
Halbertsroda with a commissary of police to put me out. You
needn’t look at me that way. There were no further consequences.
It wouldn’t have done to permit any.”</p>

<p>He fell silent. Christian got up. Voss did not urge him to
stay longer, but accompanied him to the door. There he said
in a changed voice: “What kind of a man are you? One sits
before you and pours out one’s soul, and you sit there in silence.
How does it happen?”</p>

<p>“If you regret it I shall forget all you have said,” Christian
answered in his flexible, courteous way, that always had a
touch of the equivocal.</p>

<p>Voss let his head droop. “Come in again when you are passing,”
he begged gently. “Perhaps then I’ll tell you about what
happened there!” He pointed with his thumb across his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I shall come,” said Christian.</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Albrecht Wahnschaffe came into his wife’s bedroom. She
was in bed. It was a magnificent curtained bed with carved
posters. On both sides of the wall hung costly tapestries
representing mythological scenes. A coverlet of blue damask
concealed Frau Wahnschaffe’s majestic form.</p>

<p>Gallantly he kissed the hand which she held out toward him
with a weary gesture, and glided into an armchair. “I want
to talk to you about Christian,” he said. “For some time
his doings have worried me. He drifts and drifts. The latest
thing is his purchase of that diamond. There is a challenge
in such an action. It annoys me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe wrinkled her forehead, and answered: “I
see no need to worry. Many sons of wealthy houses pass their
time as Christian does. They are like noble plants that need
adornment. They seem to me to represent a high degree of human
development. They regard themselves quite rightly as
excellent within themselves. By birth and wealth they are
freed from the necessity of effort. Their very being is in their
aristocratic aloofness and inviolability.”</p>

<p>Albrecht Wahnschaffe bowed. He played with his slender
white fingers that bore no sign of age. He said: “I’m sorry
that I cannot quite share your opinion. It seems to me that
in the social organism each member should exercise a function
that serves the whole. I was brought up with this view, and
I cannot deny it in favour of Christian. I am not inclined to
quarrel with his mere expenditure of money, though he has
exceeded his budget considerably during the last few months.
The house of Wahnschaffe cannot be touched even by such
costly pranks. What annoys me is the aimlessness of such
a life, its exceedingly obvious lack of any inner ambition.”</p>

<p>From under her wearily half-closed lids Frau Wahnschaffe
regarded her husband coolly. It angered her that he desired
to draw Christian, who had been created for repose and play,
delight and beauty, into his own turbid whirl. She answered
with a touch of impatience: “You have always let him choose
his own path, and you cannot change him now. All do not
need to toil. Business is terribly unappetizing. I have borne
two sons&mdash;one for you, one for myself. Demand of yours what
you will and let him fulfil what he can. I like to think of
mine and be happy in the thought that he is alive. If anything
has worried me it is the fact that, since his trip to England,
Christian has withdrawn himself more and more from us, and
also, I am told, from his friends. I hope it means nothing.
Perhaps there is a woman behind it. In that case it will pass;
he does not indulge in tragic passions. But talking exhausts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
me, Albrecht. If you have other arguments, I beg you to
postpone them.”</p>

<p>She turned her head aside, and closed her eyes in exhaustion.
Albrecht Wahnschaffe arose, kissed her hand with the same
gallant gesture, and went out.</p>

<p>But her saying that she had borne one son for him and one
for herself embittered him a little against his wife, whom he
commonly regarded as an inviolable being of finer stuff. Why
did I build all this? he asked himself, as he slowly passed
through the magnificent halls.</p>

<p>It was more difficult for him to approach Christian than a
member of the ministry or a distinguished foreigner. He
vacillated between issuing a request and a command. He was
not sure of his authority, and even less of any friendly understanding.
But while he was spending a few days of rest and
recreation in the family’s ancestral house at Würzburg, he sent
a message to Christian, and begged him for an interview.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Crammon wrote to Christian. It was his humour to affect
an archaic manner of speech:</p>

<p>“Most Honoured and Worthy Friend: With deep satisfaction
I learn that your Worship has ruefully returned to the god
Dionysos, and as a sign thereof laid down upon his altar a
jewel, whose price has caused the teeth of the Philistines in the
land to rattle, and their lame digestions to work with unwelcome
swiftness. Your servant, the undersigned, did, on the
contrary, when the news of happy augury came to him, perform
a dance in his lonely closet, which so shocked the ladies of his
palace that they at once called up psychiatrists on the telephone.
Thus the world, barren of understanding, is incapable
of great reflections.</p>

<p>“Unlovely are my days. I am ensnared in amorous adventures
which do not content me, and, in addition, disappoint
those who are involved. At times I sit by the charming glow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
my chimney fire, and, closing my eyes, peruse the book of
memory. A bottle of golden-hued cognac is my sole companion,
and while I nourish my heart upon its artificial warmth,
the higher regions are wont to sink into the cold mystery of
mere idiocy. My mental powers are moving, like the crab,
backward; my virile powers decline. Years ago in Paris I knew
a chess player, a purblind old German, who lost every game he
played, and exclaimed each time: ‘Where are the days in
which I vanquished the great Zuckertort?’ The latter, I must
explain, was a great master of the royal game. The necessary
application to myself embarrasses me. There was once a
Roman emperor famous above all others for his power over
women; Maxentius was, I believe, the man’s name. But were
I to exclaim: ‘Where are the days in which I rivalled the great
Maxentius?’ it were but damnable boasting!</p>

<p>“It is a pity that you cannot be a beholder when I arise from
my couch in the morning. Were this spectacle to be tested by
connoisseurs and to be enjoyed by the laity, throngs would
attend it, as whilom they did the rising of the kings of France.
The gentry of the land would come to do me reverence, and
lovely ladies would tickle me to elicit a beam of cheer upon
my face. O blessed youth, friend and playmate of my dreams,
I would have you know that the moments in which one leaves
the linen well warmed by one’s own body, and goes forth to
twelve hours of the world’s mischief, are to me moments of
incomparable pitifulness. I sit on the bed’s edge, and regard
my underwear with a loud though inward rage. Sadly I gather
the remnants of my ego, and reknot the thread of consciousness
where Morpheus cut it yestereve. My soul is strewn about,
and rolls in little globules, like mercury spilt from a broken
thermometer. Only the sacrificial fumes of the tea kettle,
the fragrance of ham and of an omelet like cowslips, and, above
all, gentle words uttered by the soft lips of my considerate
housekeepers, reconcile me to my fate.</p>

<p>“Dear old Regamey is dead. The Count Sinsheim has had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
paralytic stroke. My friend, Lady Constance Cuningham, a
member of the highest aristocracy, has married a wealthy
American bounder. The best are going, and the tree of life
is growing bare. On my trip here I stopped over in Munich
for three days as the guest of the young Imhofs. Your sister
Judith is cutting a great figure. The painters paint her, the
sculptors hew her in marble, the poets celebrate her. Yet her
ambition is still vaulting. She desires passionately a little nine-pointed
coronet upon her linen, her liveries, and her four
motors, and flirts with everything that comes from the court or
goes to it. Felix, on the contrary, being a democrat, surrounds
himself with business men, speculators, explorers, and clever
people of both sexes. Hence their house is a mixture of
Guildhall, a grain exchange, a meeting of pettifoggers, and a
jockey club. After watching the goings on for an evening, I
retired to a corner with a pretty girl, and asked her to feel my
pulse. She obeyed, and my suffering soul was soothed.</p>

<p>“Our sweet Ariel, I am told, intoxicates the Poles in Warsaw
and the Muscovites in Moscow. In the latter city the students
are said to have expressed their homage by a torchlight procession,
and the officers to have covered the snowy streets from
her dwelling to the theatre with roses. I am also told that
the Grand Duke Cyril, commonly known as the human butcher,
is half-mad with love of her, and is turning the world topsy-turvy
to get her. It fills me with a piercing, depthless melancholy
to think, O Ariel, that once I, too, felt thy breath. No
more than that; but it suffices. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le moulin n’y est plus, mais
le vent y est encore.</i></p>

<p>“With this final remark, dear brother of my heart and sorely
missed friend, I commend you to God, and beseech you to give
some sign to your affectionately longing Bernard Gervasius
C. v. W.”</p>

<p>When Christian had read the letter, he smiled, and laid it
quietly aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>On the slope of the hill behind the village Christian and
Amadeus Voss met quite by chance.</p>

<p>“I have been waiting for you all week,” said Voss.</p>

<p>“I was going to come to you to-day,” said Christian.
“Won’t you walk a little with me?”</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss turned and accompanied Christian. They
climbed the hill-top, and then turned toward the forest.
Silently they walked side by side. The sun shone through the
boughs and everything was watery. Remnants of snow rested
on the dry foliage; the ground was slippery; on the road the
water flowed in the deep ruts. When they left the forest the
sun was just setting, the sky was greenish and pink, and when
they reached the first houses of Heptrich, twilight had fallen.
On the whole way they had not exchanged a syllable. At first
Voss had deliberately not kept step with Christian. Later they
walked in a rhythmic harmony that was like the prelude to
their conversations.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry,” said Amadeus Voss; “there is an inn yonder.
Let us go.”</p>

<p>They entered the guest room, which they found empty.
They sat down at a table near the oven, for the cold air had
chilled them. A bar-maid lit a lamp, and brought what they
ordered. Christian, in an access of fear, which was less only
than his curiosity, thought: What will happen now? and
watched Voss attentively.</p>

<p>“The other day I read a moral tale in an old book,” said
Amadeus, and he used a sharpened match as a tooth-pick in a
way that made Christian tremble with nervousness. “It tells
about a king, who realized that men and things in his country
were growing worse every day, and he asked four philosophers
to find out the reason. The four wise men consulted, and then
each went to one of the four gates of the city and inscribed
thereon one of the chief reasons. The first wrote: ‘Here might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
is right, and therefore this land has no law; day is night, and
therefore this land has no road; conflict is flight, and therefore
this land has no honour.’ The second wrote: ‘One is two here,
and therefore this land has no truth; friend is enemy here,
therefore this land has no troth; evil is good, therefore we
see no piety.’ The third wrote: ‘The snail pretends to be an
eagle, and thieves hold all power.’ The fourth wrote: ‘The
will is our counsellor, and its counsel is evil; the penny pronounces
judgment, therefore our rule is vile; God is dead, and
therefore the land is filled with sins.’”</p>

<p>He threw the match away, and leaned his head upon his
hand. “In the same book,” he went on, “there is yet another
story, and perhaps you will feel the connection between the
two. Once upon a time the earth opened in the midst of
Rome, and a yawning abyss was seen. The gods were questioned,
and they made answer: ‘This abyss will not close until
some one has leaped into it of his own free will.’ None could
be persuaded to do that. At last a youth came and said: ‘If
you will let me live for one year according to my pleasure, then
at the year’s end I shall gladly and voluntarily plunge into
the abyss.’ It was decided that nothing should be forbidden
him, and he used the women and possessions of the Romans
freely and at his pleasure. All yearned for the moment to
come when they could be rid of him. And when the year
was gone, he rode up on a noble charger, and with it leaped into
the abyss, which immediately closed behind him.”</p>

<p>Christian shrugged his shoulders. “It is all dark to me,” he
said moodily. “Did you really want to tell me these old
tales? They have no meaning.”</p>

<p>Voss laughed hoarsely to himself. “You are not nimble,”
he said, “you have not a nimble mind. Have you never felt
the need of seeking refuge in some metaphor? It is like a drug
that stills pain.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean by that,” Christian said, and
again he heard the other’s soft laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us go,” said Christian and arose.</p>

<p>“Very well. Let us go.” Voss spoke with a morose air.
And they went.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>The night air was very still and the sky sown with stars
that gleamed coldly. When the village lay behind them, they
heard no sound.</p>

<p>“How long were you in Ribbeck’s house?” Christian asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Ten months,” Amadeus Voss replied. “When I got to
Halbertsroda, the land lay under ice and snow. When I left,
the land lay under ice and snow. Between my coming and
going, there was a spring, a summer, and an autumn.”</p>

<p>He stopped for a moment, and gazed after an animal that in
the darkness leaped across the road and disappeared in the
furrows of a field. Then he began to talk, at first in a staccato
manner and drily, then vividly and tempestuously, and at last
gasping for breath. They wandered away from the road, but
were not aware of it; the hour grew late, but they did not
know it.</p>

<p>Voss told his story:</p>

<p>“I had never seen a house like that. The carpets, pictures,
tapestries, the silver, the many servants&mdash;it was all new to
me. I had never eaten of such dishes nor slept in such beds.
I came from amid four bare walls, from a cot, an iron stove,
a wash stand, a book shelf, and a crucifix.</p>

<p>“My two pupils were eleven and thirteen. The older was
blond and spare, the younger brunette and stocky. Their
hair hung down their shoulders like manes. From the very
first hour they treated me with a jeering resistance. At first I
did not see Frau Ribbeck at all. Not till a week had passed
did she summon me. She made the impression of a young girl;
she had rust-red hair and a pale, intimidated, undeveloped face.
She treated me with a contempt that I had not expected, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
that drove the blood into my temples. My meals were served
to me alone. I was not permitted to eat at the master’s table,
and the servants treated me as their equal. That gnawed at
me cruelly. When Frau Ribbeck appeared in the garden and I
lifted my hat, she barely nodded, blind and shameless in her
contempt for one whom she paid. I was no more to her than
thin air!</p>

<p>“It is as old as the world, this sin that was sinned against my
soul. Ye sinners against my soul, why did you let me famish?
Why did I taste of renunciation while ye revelled? How
shall a hungry man withstand the temptations which the living
Tempter places before him? Do you think we are not aware
of your gluttony? All action, whether good or evil, runs
through all nature. When the grape blossoms in Madeira, the
wine that has been pressed from it stirs in a thousand casks
far over sea and land, and a new fermentation sets in.</p>

<p>“One morning the boys locked the door of their room and
refused to come to their instruction. While I shook the knob
they mocked me from within. In the halls the servants stood
and laughed at my powerlessness. I went to the gardener, borrowed
an axe, and crashed through the door with three blows.
A minute later I was in the room. The boys looked at me in
consternation, and realized at last that I would not endure
their insolence. The noise had brought Frau Ribbeck to the
scene. She looked at the broken door and then at me. I
shall never forget that look. She did not turn her eyes from
me even while she was speaking to the children, and that was
at least ten minutes. Her eyes asked: How dare you? Who
are you? When she went out, she saw the axe near the door
and stopped a moment, and I saw her shiver. But I knew that
the direction of the wind had changed. Also it came into my
consciousness that a human woman had stood before me.</p>

<p>“The teasing of my pupils was by no means at an end. On
the contrary, they annoyed me as much as possible. But they
did it secretively now, and the blame was hard to fix. I found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
pebbles and needles in my bed, ink spilled over my books, a
horrible rent in the best suit of clothes I had. They jeered at
me before others, lied about me to their mother, and exchanged
glances of shameless insolence when I held them responsible.
What they did was not like the ordinary mischief of silly boys.
They had been sophisticated by luxury. They were afraid of
a draught, had the rooms so overheated that one grew faint,
and thought of nothing but physical comforts. Once they
fought, and the younger bit the older’s finger. The boy went
to bed for three days, and insisted that a physician be called.
Nor was this merely a case of lazy malingering; bottomless
malevolence and vengefulness entered into it. They considered
me as far beneath them, and lost no chance to make me feel
my dependent position. My mood was often bitter, but I
determined to practise patience.</p>

<p>“One evening I entered the drawing-room. The hour which
I had set as the boys’ bed-time was past. Frau Ribbeck sat
on the carpet, the boys snuggled on either side of her. She was
showing them the pictures in a book. Her hair hung loose,&mdash;an
unfitting thing, I thought&mdash;and its reddish splendour covered
her as well as the boys like a mantle of brocade. The boys
fixed green and evil eyes upon me. I ordered them to bed at
once. There must have been something in my tone that
frightened them and forced them to obey. Without contradiction
they got up and retired.</p>

<p>“Adeline remained on the carpet. I shall simply call her
Adeline, as, indeed, I did later during our intercourse. She
looked at me exactly as she had done that day I had used the
axe. One cannot well be paler than she was by nature, but her
skin now became positively transparent. She arose, went to
the table, lifted some indifferent object, and put it down again.
At the same time a mocking smile hovered upon her lips. That
smile went through and through me. And indeed the woman
herself pierced me, body and soul. You’ll misunderstand me.
It doesn’t matter. If you don’t understand, no explanations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
will do any good. The sheet of ice above me cracked, and
I had a glimpse of the upper world.”</p>

<p>“I believe I do understand you,” said Christian.</p>

<p>“To my question whether she desired me to leave the house,
she replied that, since her husband had engaged me, it was for
her to respect the arrangement. Her tone was frosty. I replied
that the pressure of her dislike made it impossible for my
activities to be fruitful. With an indirect glance at me, she
answered that some method of decent co-operation could probably
be found, and that she would think it over. Beginning
with that evening, I was invited to table with her, and the
boys and she treated me with respect, if not with kindness.
Late one evening she sent for me and asked me to read to
her. She gave me the book from which I was to read. It was
a current fashionable novel, and, after I had read a few pages,
I threw the volume on the table, and said that the stuff nauseated
me. She nodded, and answered that that was quite her
feeling, too, which she had not wanted to admit even to herself,
and that she was grateful to me for my frankness. I went
for my Bible, and read her the story of Samson from the Book
of Judges. It must have seemed naïve to her, for when I had
finished that mocking smile played again about her lips. Then
she asked: ‘It’s hardly necessary, is it, to be a hero in Judah
to share Samson’s fate? And do you think that what Delilah
accomplished was so remarkable?’ I replied that I had no
experience of such matters, and she laughed.</p>

<p>“One word led to another, and I gathered the courage to
reproach her with the morally neglected condition of her children,
and with the wounding and vulgar quality of all I had so
far seen and experienced in her house. I intentionally used the
sharpest words, in order that she might flare up in wrath and
show me the door. But she remained quite calm, and begged
me to explain my ideas more fully. I did so, not without passion,
and she heard me with pleasure. Several times I saw her
breathe deeply and stretch herself and close her eyes. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
contradicted me, then agreed, defended her position, and in the
end admitted it to be indefensible. I told her that the love
which she thought she felt for her sons was really a sort of
hatred, based on a poisoning of her own soul, in which there
was yet another life and another love, which it was wicked to
condemn to withering and death. She must have misunderstood
me at this point, for she looked at me with her large eyes
suddenly, and bade me go. When I had closed her door behind
me, I heard sobs. I opened the door again, and saw her
sitting there with her face hidden in her hands. I had the
impulse to return to her. But her gesture dismissed me.</p>

<p>“I had never before seen any woman cry except my mother.
I cannot tell you of my feelings. If I had had a sister and
grown up in her companionship, I might have acted and felt
differently. But Adeline was the first woman whom, in any
deeper sense, I truly saw.</p>

<p>“Several days later she asked me whether I had any hope of
forming her boys into human beings in my sense. She said that
she had reflected on all I had urged, and had come to the
conclusion that things could not go on as they were. I
answered that it was not yet too late. She begged me to save
what was possible, and announced that, in order to leave me a
free hand, she had determined to travel for a few months.
Three days later she departed. She took no personal farewell
of her sons, but wrote them a letter from Dresden.</p>

<p>“I took the boys with me to a hunting lodge, that lay isolated
in the woods, at a distance of two hours from Halbertsroda.
It belonged to the Ribbeck estate, and Adeline had assigned
it to me as a refuge. There I settled down with the boys and
took them sternly in hand. Sometimes dread overcame me,
when I thought of the words of Scripture: Why do you seek
constantly to change your way? Beware lest you be deceived
by Egypt, as you were deceived by Assyria.</p>

<p>“A deaf, old man-servant cooked for us, and luxurious meals
were a thing of the past. The boys had to pray, to fast once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
a week, to sleep on hard mattresses, and to rise at five in the
morning. In every way I broke down their stubbornness, their
dull sloth, their furtive sensuality, their plots and tricks.
There was no play now, and the days were divided with iron
regularity. I shrank from no severity. I chastised them; at
the slightest disobedience I used a whip. I taught them the
meaning of pain. When they cowered naked before me, with
the bloody stripes on their bodies, I spoke to them of the martyrdom
of the saints. I kept a diary, in order that Adeline
might know exactly what had happened. The boys started
when they heard me from afar; they trembled if I but raised
my head. Once I came upon them whispering to each other in
bed at night. I drove them out. They screamed and fled out
of the house from me. In their night shifts they ran into the
forest, and I, with two dogs following me, pursued them. Rain
began to pour, and at last they broke down and threw themselves
on the ground and begged for mercy. Most difficult of
all it was to lead them to Confession. But I was stronger than
the Evil One within them, and forced them to cleanse their
souls. Bitter hours were the hours I endured. But I had
made a vow to Adeline in my heart.</p>

<p>“The boys became thoughtful, subdued, and silent. They
went into corners and wept. When Adeline returned I took
them to Halbertsroda, and she marvelled at the change in them.
They flung themselves into her arms, but they uttered no
complaint against me, either then or when they were left alone
with her. I had told them that if they were disobedient or
stubborn, we would return to the hunting lodge. One or two
days a week were spent there under any circumstances. Gradually
they came to avoid their mother, and Adeline herself was
more indifferent to them. The softish, hectic, over-tender
element in their relations had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Adeline sought my companionship and conversation. She
watched me, and was condescending, weary, distracted in
mind, and restless. She adorned herself as though guests were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
coming, and combed her hair thrice daily. In all respects she
submitted to my regulations. There are dulled, worm-eaten,
smouldering souls that kneel before the raised axe in another’s
hand, and give only mockery to those who bend before them.
Often her loftiness and reserve overwhelmed me, and I thought
that she had no space for me in her mind. Then a look came
into her eyes that made me forget whence I came and what I
was in her house. Everything seemed possible with her. She
was capable of setting fire to the house by night, because she was
bored, and because the cancer that ate at her soul would cease
its gnawing for no nobler ecstasy: she was capable of standing
from noon to night before her mirror to watch a deepening
furrow on her brow. Everything seemed possible. For is it
not written: What man knoweth what is in man except only the
spirit of man that is in him?</p>

<p>“My deep temptations began on an evening when, in the
course of conversation, she carelessly laid her hand over mine,
and withdrew it hastily. That gesture snatched from my
sight the things about us. In the space between one thought
and the next I had become the slave of visions and desires.</p>

<p>“She asked me to tell her about my life. I fell into that
snare too, and told her.</p>

<p>“Once in the twilight I met her in the hall. She stood still,
and looked at me piercingly. Then she laughed softly and
moved away. I reeled, and the sweat stood in beads on my
forehead.</p>

<p>“My heart was heavy when I was alone. Visions appeared
that set my room in flames. My rosary and my missal were
hidden from me, and I could find neither. Always there rose
the cry in me: Once only! Let me taste that ecstasy but once!
Then demons came and tormented me. All the muscles and
nerves and sinews of my body seemed lacerated. Do with me
as God wills, I whispered to the demons, for my heart is prepared.
During sleep a strange force hurled me from my bed,
and unconsciously I battered the walls with my head. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
whole week I fasted upon bread and water, but it did not avail.
Once when I had sat down to read, a huge ape stood before
me and turned the leaves of my book. Every night a seductive
vision of Adeline came to my bed-side. She stood there
and spoke: ‘It is I, my beloved.’ Then I would rise and run
senselessly about. But she would follow me and whisper:
‘You shall be my master and have all the good things of this
world.’ But when I sought to grasp that vision of her, it
showed a sudden aversion, and she called fluttering shadows to
her aid. One was a notary with a pen and an ink-well,
another a locksmith with a red-hot hammer, there was a mason
with his trowel, an officer with naked sword, a woman with a
painted face.</p>

<p>“So terrible was my state, that I understood but slowly and
gradually the dreadful realities that took place about me. One
morning Adeline came into the room where I was teaching the
boys, sat down, and listened. She drew from her finger a ring
that had in it a great, lovely pearl, played with it thoughtfully,
arose, went to the window to watch the falling of the
snow, and then left the room to go into the garden. I could
not breathe or see any longer. There was an intolerable pressure
on my chest, and I had to leave the room for a little to
catch my breath. When I returned I saw in the eyes of my
pupils a look of unwonted malevolence. I paid no attention
to it. From time to time the old rebelliousness flared up in
them, but I let them be. They sat before me half-crouching,
and recited their catechism softly and with glances full of fear.</p>

<p>“About ten minutes passed when Adeline returned. She said
she had left her ring on the table, and asked me whether I
had seen it. She began to search for it, and so did I. She
called her maid and a footman, who examined everything in
the room; but the ring was gone. Adeline and her servants
looked at me strangely, for I stood there and could not move.
I felt at once and in every fibre that I was exposed to their
suspicion. They searched on the stairs and in the hall, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
new fallen snow of the garden, and again in the room, since
Adeline insisted that she had taken the ring off there and
forgotten it on the table. And I confirmed this statement,
although I had not actually seen the ring on the table, since
I had seen her and her gestures but as things in a dream.
All the words that were exchanged between her and the
servants seemed directed against me. I read suspicion in their
looks and changed colour, and called the boys, who had stolen
away as soon as they could, and questioned them. They suggested
that their rooms be searched, and looked at me with
malignity. I begged Adeline to have my room searched as
well. She made a deprecating gesture, but said, as though in
self-justification, that she attached a peculiar value to this ring
and should hate to lose it.</p>

<p>“Meantime the manager of the estate, who happened to have
spent that night at Halbertsroda, entered. He passed me
by without greeting, but with a dark and hostile glance.
Then it all came over me. I saw myself delivered over
to their suspicions without defence, and I said to myself:
Perhaps you have really stolen the ring. The fall from
my previous spiritual condition to this vulgar and ugly one
was so sudden, that I broke out into wild laughter, and
insisted more urgently than ever that my room and effects and
even my person be searched. The manager spoke softly to
Adeline. She looked at me wanly and went out. I emptied
my pockets in the man’s presence. He followed me to my room.
I sat down by the window while he opened drawer after drawer
in my chest and opened my wardrobe. The footman, the maid,
and the two boys stood by the door. Suddenly the manager
uttered a hollow cry and held up the ring. I had known with
the utmost certainty a moment before that he would find the
ring. I had read it in the faces of the boys. Therefore I remained
quietly seated while the others looked at one another
and followed the manager out. I locked my door and walked
up and down, up and down, for many, many hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“When the night was over, there was a solemn calm in my
soul. I sent a servant to ask Adeline whether she would receive
me. She refused. To justify myself in writing was a thing I
scorned to do. I would but degrade myself by asserting my innocence
thus. My soul felt pure and cold. I learned next day
that the manager had long heard rumours of the frightful cruelties
I was said to inflict on the boys, who had, moreover, accused
their mother and myself of an adulterous intimacy.
Hence he had visited Halbertsroda secretly on several occasions,
had questioned the servants, and had, that very morning, caused
the boys to strip in his presence and had seen on their bodies
the marks of the stripes that they had received. Since, in
addition, their entire state of mind made him anxious, he sent
a telegram to the Councillor, who arrived during the night
with an official of the police.</p>

<p>“I suspect that Adeline at once saw through the plot
concerning the ring, for it was not mentioned. The commissary
turned to me and spoke vaguely of serious consequences,
but I made no attempt to explain or excuse anything
I had done. I left Halbertsroda that same night. I did not
see Adeline again. She was, I have been told, sent off to a
sanatorium. Three weeks later a little package came to me by
post. I opened it and found in it the ring with the pearl. In
our yard is a very ancient well. I went to that well and cast
the ring into its depths.</p>

<p>“And now you know what happened to me in that world of
the higher classes, in the house of the Councillor Ribbeck.”</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>They had to walk a while longer before they reached the
gate of the park of Christian’s Rest. As Voss was about to
take his leave, Christian said: “You’re probably tired. Why
trouble to walk to the village? Be my guest over night.”</p>

<p>“If it does not inconvenience you, I accept,” Voss answered.</p>

<p>They entered the house and passed into the brightly lit hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Amadeus Voss gazed about him in astonishment. They went
up the stairs and into the dining hall, which was furnished in
the purest style of Louis XV. Christian led his guest through
other rooms into the one that was to be his. And Amadeus
Voss wondered more and more. “This is quite another thing
from Halbertsroda,” he murmured; “it is as a feast day compared
to every day.”</p>

<p>Silently they sat opposite each other at table. Then they
went into the library. A footman served the coffee on a silver
platter. Voss leaned against a column and looked upward.
When the servant had gone, he said: “Have you ever heard of
the Telchinian pestilence? It is a disease created by the envy
of the Telchines, the hounds of Actæon who were changed into
men, and it destroys everything within its reach. A youth
named Euthilides saw with that eye of envy the reflection of
his own beauty in a spring, and his beauty faded.”</p>

<p>Christian looked silently at the floor.</p>

<p>“There is another legend of a Polish nobleman,” Amadeus
continued. “This nobleman lived alone in a white house by
the Vistula river. All his neighbours avoided him, for his
envious glance brought them nothing but misfortune. It killed
their herds, set fire to their barns, and made their children
leprous. Once a beautiful maiden was pursued by wolves
and took refuge in the white house. He fell in love with her
and married her. But because the evil that was in him passed
into her also, he tore out the gleaming crystals of his eyes, and
buried them near the garden wall. He had now recovered.
But the buried eyes gained new power under the earth, and an
old servitor who dug them up was slain by them.”</p>

<p>Sitting on a low stool, Christian had folded his arms over
his knee, and looked up at Voss.</p>

<p>“From time to time,” said Amadeus Voss, “one must expiate
the lust of the eye. Over in the village of Nettersheim
a maid servant lies dying. The poor thing is deserted by all the
world. She lies in a shed by the stables, and the peasants who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
think her merely lazy will not believe that she is about to die.
I have visited her more than once, in order to expiate the
lust of the eye.”</p>

<p>A long silence fell upon them. When the clock in the tall
Gothic case struck twelve, they went to their rooms.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>In obedience to his father’s summons, Christian travelled to
Würzburg.</p>

<p>Their greeting was most courteous. “I hope I have not
interfered with any plans of yours,” said Albrecht Wahnschaffe.</p>

<p>“I am at your disposal,” Christian said coolly.</p>

<p>They took a walk on the old ramparts but said little. The
beautiful dog Freia, who was the constant companion of
Albrecht Wahnschaffe, trotted along between them. It surprised
the elder Wahnschaffe to observe on Christian’s face
the signs of inner change.</p>

<p>That evening, over their tea, he said with an admirably
generous gesture. “You’re to be congratulated, I understand,
on a very unusual acquisition. A wreath of legends surrounds
this diamond. The incident has caused quite a whirl of dust
to fly and not a little amazement. Not unjustly so, it seems
to me, since you are neither a British Duke nor an Indian
Maharajah. Is the stone so very desirable?”</p>

<p>“It is marvellous,” Christian said. And suddenly the words
of Voss slipped into his mind: One must expiate the lust of the
eye.</p>

<p>Albrecht Wahnschaffe nodded. “I don’t doubt it, and I
understand such passions, though, as a man of business, I
must regret the tying up of so much capital. It is an eccentricity;
and the world is endangered whenever the commoners
grow eccentric. And so I should like to ask you to reflect
on this aspect of things: all the privileges which you
enjoy, all the easements of life, the possibility of satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
your whims and passions, the supremacy of your social station&mdash;all
these things rest on work. Need I add&mdash;on the work of
your father?”</p>

<p>The dog Freia had strolled out from a corner of the room,
and laid her head caressingly on Christian’s knee. Albrecht
Wahnschaffe, slightly annoyed and jealous, gave her a smart
slap on one flank.</p>

<p>He continued. “An exploitation of one’s capacity for work
which reaches the extent of mine involves, of course, the
broadest self-denial in all other matters. One becomes a
ploughshare that tears up the earth and rusts. Or one is like
a burning substance, luminiferous but self-consumed. Marriage,
family, friendship, art, nature&mdash;these things scarcely
exist for me. I have lived like a miner in his shaft. And what
thanks do I get? Demagogues tell those whom they delude
that I am a vampire, who sucks the blood of the oppressed.
These poisoners of our public life either do not know or do
not wish to know the shocks and sufferings and renunciations
that have been mine, and of which their peaceful ‘wage-slave’
has no conception.”</p>

<p>Freia snuggled closer up to Christian, licked his hand, and
her eyes begged humbly for a look. The beast’s dumb tenderness
soothed him. He frowned, and said laconically: “If it is
so, and you feel it so keenly, why do you go on working?”</p>

<p>“There is such a thing as duty, my dear spoiled boy, such
a thing as loyalty to a cause,” Albrecht Wahnschaffe answered,
and a gleam of anger showed in his pale-blue eyes. “Every
peasant clings to the bit of earth into which he has put his
toil. When I began to work, our country was still a poor
country; to-day it is rich. I shall not say that what I have
accomplished is considerable, when compared to the sum of
our national accomplishment, but it has counted. It is a symptom
of our rise, of our young might, of our economic welfare.
We are one of the very great nations now, and have a body as
well as a countenance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“What you say is doubtless most true,” Christian answered.
“Unhappily I have no instinct for such matters; my personality
is defective in things of that kind.”</p>

<p>“A quarter of a century ago your fate would have been
that of a bread earner,” Albrecht Wahnschaffe continued, without
reacting to Christian’s words. “To-day you are a descendant
and an heir. Your generation looks upon a changed world
and age. We older men have fastened wings upon your
shoulders, and you have forgotten how painful it is to creep.”</p>

<p>Christian, in a sombre longing for the warmth of some body,
took the dog’s head between his hands, and with a grunt of
gratitude she raised herself up and laid her paws on his
shoulders. With a smile, that included his petting of the dog,
he said: “No one refuses the good things that fall into his lap.
It is true I have never asked whence everything comes and
whither it tends. To be sure, there are other ways of living;
and I may yet embrace one of them some day. Then it will
be apparent whether one becomes another man, and what kind,
when the supports or the wings, as you put it, are gone.”
His face had grown serious.</p>

<p>Albrecht Wahnschaffe suddenly felt himself rather helpless
before this handsome, proud stranger who was his son. To
hide his embarrassment, he answered hastily: “A different way
of living&mdash;that is just what I mean. It was the conviction that
a life which is nothing but a chain of trifles must in the end
become a burden, that made me suggest a career to you that is
worthier of your powers and gifts. How would you like the
profession of diplomacy? Wolfgang seems thoroughly satisfied
with the possibilities that he sees opening up before him. It
is not too late for you either. It will not be difficult to make
up the time lost. Your name outweighs any title of nobility.
You would stay in a suitable atmosphere; you have large
means, the necessary personal qualities and relations. Everything
will adjust itself automatically.”</p>

<p>Christian shook his head. “You are mistaken, father,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
said, softly but firmly. “I have no capacity for anything like
that, and no taste for it at all.”</p>

<p>“I suspected as much,” Albert Wahnschaffe said, in his
liveliest manner. “Let us not speak of it any more. My
second proposal is far more congenial to myself. I would encourage
you to co-operate in the activities of our firm. My
plan is to create a representative position for you in either our
home or our foreign service. If you choose the latter you may
select your own field of activity&mdash;Japan, let us say, or the
United States. We would furnish you with credentials that
would make your position very independent. You would assume
responsibilities that are in no wise burdensome, and enjoy all
the privileges of an ambassador. All that is needed is your
consent. I shall arrange all details.”</p>

<p>Christian arose from his chair. “I beg you very earnestly,
father, to drop that subject,” he said. His expression was cold
and his eyes cast down.</p>

<p>Albrecht Wahnschaffe arose too. “Do not be rash, Christian,”
he admonished his son. “I shall not conceal the fact
that a definitive refusal on your part would wound me deeply.
I have counted on you.” He looked at Christian with a firm
glance. But Christian was silent.</p>

<p>After a while he asked: “How long ago is it since you were
at the works?”</p>

<p>“It must be three or four years ago,” Christian answered.</p>

<p>“It was three years ago on Whitsuntide, if I remember
rightly,” Albrecht Wahnschaffe said, with his habitual touch
of pride in his memory, which was rarely at fault. “You had
agreed on a pleasure trip in the Harz mountains with your
cousin, Theo Friesen, and Theo was anxious to pay a flying
visit to the factories. He had heard of our new welfare movement
for workingmen, and was interested in it. But you
scarcely stopped after all.”</p>

<p>“No, I persuaded Theo to go on. We had a long way ahead
of us, and I was anxious to get to our quarters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian remembered the whole incident now. Evening
had come before the car drove through the streets of the factory
village. He had yielded to his cousin’s wish, but suddenly
his aversion for this world of smoke and dust and sweat
and iron had awakened. He had not wanted to leave the car,
and had ordered the driver to speed up.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he recalled the hellish music made up of beaten
steel and whirring wheels. He could still hear the thundering,
whistling, wheezing, screeching, hissing; he could still see the
swift procession of forges, cylinders, pumps, steam-hammers,
furnaces, of all kinds; the thousands of blackened faces, a race
that seemed made of coal in the breath of the fierce glow of
white and crimson fires; misty electric moons that quivered in
space; vehicles like death barrows swallowed up in the violet
darkness; the workingmen’s homes, with their appearance of
comfort, and their reality of a bottomless dreariness; the baths,
libraries, club-houses, crêches, hospitals, infants’ homes, ware-houses,
churches, and cinemas. The stamp of force and servitude,
of all that is ugliest on earth, was bedizened and tinted in
fair colours here, and all menaces were throttled and fettered.</p>

<p>Young Friesen had exhausted himself with admiration, but
Christian had not breathed freely again until their car was
out on the open road and had left the flaring horror in its
panic flight.</p>

<p>“And you have not been there since?” Albrecht Wahnschaffe
asked.</p>

<p>“No, not since that day.”</p>

<p>For a while they stood opposite each other in silence.
Albrecht Wahnschaffe took Freia by her collar, and said with
notable self-control: “Take counsel with yourself. There is
time. I shall not urge you unduly, but rather wait. When you
come to weigh the circumstances, and test your own mind,
you will realize that I have your welfare at heart. Do not
answer me now. When you have made a clear decision&mdash;let
me know what it is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Have I your permission to retire?” Christian asked. His
father nodded, and he bowed and left the room.</p>

<p>Next morning he returned to Christian’s Rest.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>In a side street of the busiest quarter of Buenos Ayres, there
stood a house that belonged to the Gunderam family. The
parents of Gottlieb Gunderam had bought it when they came
to the Argentine in the middle of the nineteenth century. In
those days its value had been small, but the development of
the city had made it a considerable property. Gottfried Gunderam
received tempting offers for it, not only from private
dealers, but from the municipality. The rickety house was to
be torn down, and to be replaced by a modern apartment
house.</p>

<p>But Gottfried Gunderam turned a deaf ear to all offers.
“The house in which my mother died,” he declared, “shall not
be sold to strangers so long as the breath is in my body.”</p>

<p>This determination did not arise so much from filial piety,
as from a superstition that was powerful enough to silence even
his greed. He feared that his mother would arise from her
grave and avenge herself on him, if he permitted the family’s
ancestral home to be sold and destroyed. Wealth, good
harvests, a great age, and general well-being were, in his
opinion, dependent on his action in this matter. He would not
even allow strangers to enter the house.</p>

<p>His sons and kinsmen mockingly called it the Escurial.
Gottfried Gunderam took no notice of their jeers, but he himself
had, gradually and quite seriously, slipped into the habit
of calling the house the Escurial.</p>

<p>One day, long before his voyage to Germany, Stephen had
cleverly taken advantage of his father in an hour when the
old man was tipsy and merry, and had extorted a promise that
the Escurial was to be his upon his marriage. When he came
home with Letitia he counted upon the fulfilment of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
promise. He intended to establish himself as a lawyer in
Buenos Ayres, and restore the neglected house.</p>

<p>He reminded his father of the compact. The old man denied
it bluntly. He winked gravely. “Can you show me any
record&mdash;black on white? Well, then, what do you want?
A fine lawyer you are to think that you can enforce an agreement
of which there is no record!”</p>

<p>Stephen did not reply. But from time to time&mdash;coldly,
methodically, calmly&mdash;he reminded the old man of his
promise.</p>

<p>The old man said: “The woman you have married is not to
my taste. She doesn’t fit into our life. She reads and reads.
It’s sickening. She’s a milk-faced doll without sap. Let her
be content with what she has. I shan’t be such a fool as to
plunge into expenditures on your account. It would cost a
pretty penny to make the Escurial habitable. And I have no
cash. Absolutely none.”</p>

<p>Stephen estimated the available capital of his father as
amounting to between four and five millions. “You owe me
my patrimony,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I owe you a damned good thrashing!” the old man replied
grimly.</p>

<p>“Is that your last word?”</p>

<p>The old man answered: “Far from it. I won’t speak my last
word for a dozen years. But I like peace at home, and so I’ll
make a bargain with you. Whenever your wife gives birth
to a man-child, you shall have the Escurial, and fifty thousand
pesos to boot.”</p>

<p>“Give me the promise in writing! Black on white counts&mdash;as
you yourself said.”</p>

<p>The old man laughed a dry laugh. “Good!” he cried, and
winked with both eyes. “You’re improving. Glad to see
that the money spent on your legal studies wasn’t quite
wasted.” With a sort of glee he sat down at his desk, and
made out the required document.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>A few weeks later Stephen said to Letitia: “Let us drive
to the city. I want to show you the Escurial.”</p>

<p>The only living creature in that house was a mulatto woman
ninety years old. To rouse her one had to throw stones against
the wooden shutters. Then she appeared, bent almost double,
half-blind, clothed in rags, a yellow growth on her forehead.</p>

<p>The street, which had been laid out a century before, was
a yard deeper than the more recent ones; and Stephen and
Letitia had to use a short ladder to reach the door of the house.
Within everything was mildewed and rotten, the furniture and
the floors. In the corners the spiders’ webs were like clouds,
and fat hairy spiders sat in them peacefully. The wall-paper
was in rags, the window-panes were broken, and the fire-places
had caved in.</p>

<p>But in the room in which the mother of Gunderam had died,
there stood a beautiful inlaid table, an antique piece from a
convent of Siena. The mosaic showed two angels inclining
palm-branches toward each other, and between the two sat
an eagle. Upon the table lay the dead woman’s jewels.
Brooches and chains, rings and ear-rings and bracelets, had
lain here dust-covered for many, many years. The reputation
of the old house as being haunted had protected them more
effectually than barred windows.</p>

<p>Letitia was frightened, and thought: “Am I to live here
where ghosts may appear at night to don their old splendour?”</p>

<p>But when Stephen explained his plans for rebuilding and
redecorating, she recovered her gaiety, and her imagination
transformed these decayed rooms into inviting chambers and
dainty boudoirs, cool halls with tall windows and airy, carpeted
stairs.</p>

<p>“It depends quite simply on you whether we can have a
happy and beautiful home very soon,” Stephen declared. “I’m
doing my share. I wish I could say the same of you.”</p>

<p>Letitia looked away. She knew the condition which old
Gunderam had made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Again and again she had to disappoint Stephen. The
Escurial lay in its deathlike sleep, and her husband’s face grew
more and more sombre. He sent her to church to pray; he
strewed her bed with ground wall-nuts; he made her drink a
powder of bones dissolved in wine. He sent for an old crone
who was gifted in magic, and Letitia had to stand naked,
surrounded by seven tapers, and let the woman murmur over
her body. And she went to church and prayed, although she
had no faith in her praying and felt no devotion and knew
nothing of God. Yet she shuddered at the murmurs of the
Italian witch, although when it was all over, she laughed and
made light of the whole thing.</p>

<p>In spirit she conceived the image of the child which her
body denied her. The image was of uncertain sex, but of
flawless loveliness. It had the soft eyes of a deer, the features
of one of Raphael’s angels, and the exquisite soul of an ode
by Hölderlin. It was destined to great things, and the dizzying
curve of its fortune knew no decline. The thought of this
dream child filled her with vaguely beautiful emotions, and she
was amazed at Stephen’s anger and growing impatience. She
was amazed and was conscious of no guilt.</p>

<p>Stephen’s mother, who was known as Doña Barbara to
every one, said to her son: “I bore your father eight living
creatures. Three are dead. Four are strong men. We need
not even count your sister Esmeralda. Why is this woman
barren? Chastise her, my son, beat her!”</p>

<p>Stephen gritted his teeth, and took up his ox-hide whip.</p>


<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>It was evening, and Christian went to the forester’s house.
The way was very familiar to him now. He did not analyze
the inner compulsion that drew him thither.</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss sat by his lamp and read in an old book.
Through the second door of the room the shadow of his mother
slipped away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while he asked: “Will you go with me to-morrow
to Nettersheim?”</p>

<p>“What am I to do there?” Christian questioned in his turn.</p>

<p>Amadeus raised his face, and his spectacles glimmered. He
murmured: “She may be dead by this time.”</p>

<p>He drummed on his knees with his fingers. Since Christian
said nothing, he began to tell him the story of the woman
Walpurga, who was in the service of his uncle, the wealthy
farmer Borsche.</p>

<p>“She was born in the village, a cottager’s daughter. At
fifteen she went to the city. She had heard of the fine life one
leads there and had great ambitions. She was in service here
and there. Last she was in the house of a merchant whose son
seduced her; and of course, when it was discovered, she was
driven out. So it comes to pass that those who are by nature
the victims must bear a punishment in addition.</p>

<p>“She bore a child, but the child died. She fell deeper and
deeper, until she became a street-walker. She practised this
calling in Bochum and in Elberfeld. But the life wore on her,
and she fell ill. One day a great home-sickness came upon her.
She mustered her last strength, and returned to her native
village. She was penniless and weak, but she was anxious to
earn her bread, no matter at what wage or through what labour.</p>

<p>“But no one would hire her. Her parents were dead and she
had no relatives, so she became a public charge. She was made
to feel it grievously. One Sunday the minister inveighed
against her from the pulpit. He did not mention her name, but
he spoke of vile lives and sinks of iniquity, of visitations and
punishments, and of how the anger of the Lord was visible
in an example that was before the eyes of all. Thus she was
branded and publicly delivered over to the scorn of all people,
and she determined to put an end to her life. One evening,
as Borsche was returning from his inn, he saw a woman lying
in the road in dreadful convulsions. It was Walpurga. No
man was near. Borsche lifted her on his broad back, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
carried her to his farm. She confessed that she had scraped
the phosphorus from many matches and eaten it. The farmer
gave her milk as an antidote. She recovered, and was permitted
to stay on the farm.</p>

<p>“On some days she could work, and then she dragged herself
to the fields. On others she could not, and lay in a remote
corner. The men servants, of whom there were many, regarded
her body as common property. Resistance was useless.
Not until Borsche learned this, and blazed out in anger, did
things get better. She was only twenty-three, and despite her
illness and the wretchedness of her life, she had preserved much
of her youthful good looks. Her cheeks had a natural glow
and her eyes were clear. So whenever she could not work,
the other maids fell upon her, and called her a malingering
bawd.</p>

<p>“Two weeks ago I happened to be wandering in the neighbourhood
of Nettersheim, and stopped at Borsche’s house. I
was well received there, for the family think highly of me as a
future priest. They talked about Walpurga. The farmer told
me her story, and asked me to have a look at her and give my
opinion as to whether she was really ill. I objected, and asked
why a physician had not seen her. He said that the doctor
from Heftrich had examined her and could find nothing
wrong. So I went to her. She lay in a shed, separated from
the cows only by a wooden partition. She was wrapped in an
old horse-blanket, and a little straw kept the chill of the
earth from her body. Her healthy colour and her normal
form did not deceive me. I said to the farmer: ‘She’s like
a guttering candle.’ He and his wife seemed to believe me.
But when I demanded of them that they give the sick woman
decent lodging and care, they shrugged their shoulders, and
said that it was as warm in the stable as anywhere, and that
there was no sense in taking trouble or undergoing discomfort
on account of a creature who had fallen so low.</p>

<p>“On the third day I saw her again, and I have seen her on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
every other day since then. My thoughts could not get rid
of her any more. In all my life no human creature has so
tugged at my heart. She could no longer get up; the most
malevolent had to admit that. I sat with her in the evil
smelling shed on a wooden bench near where she lay. Each
time I came she was happier to see me. I picked wild flowers
on the way, and she took them in her hands and held them
against her breast. They told her who I was, and gradually
she put many questions to me. She wanted to know whether
there really was an eternal life and eternal bliss. She wanted
to know whether Christ had died on the cross for her too.
She was afraid of the torments of purgatory, and said if they
were as bad as the torments men could inflict she was sorry
for the immortal part of her. She meant neither to revile
men nor to complain of them. She merely wanted to
know.</p>

<p>“And what answer could I give her? I assured her that
Christ had taken her cross upon Him too. Her other questions
left me silent. One is so dumb and desperate when a living
heart thirsts after truth, and the frozen Christ within would
melt into a new day and a new sun. They are even now in
purgatory and ask when it will begin. Hidden in blackness,
they do not see the dark; consumed by flames, they are unaware
of the fire. Where is Satan’s true kingdom&mdash;here or
elsewhere? And can that elsewhere be upon any star more
accursed than this? The poor man is thrust from the wayside,
the oppressed of the land creep into hiding; from the cities
come the moans of the dying, and the souls of those who are
wounded to death cry out. Yet God does not put an end to the
iniquity. And is it not written that the Lord said to Satan:
‘From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord,
and said, From going to and fro in the earth and from walking
up and down in it.’</p>

<p>“She confessed her sins to me, and begged me to grant her
absolution. But nothing that seemed sinful to her seemed so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to me. I saw the desolateness and loneliness of the world. I
saw the bleak rooms and the barren walls, the streets by night
with their flickering lamps, and the men with no compassion
in their eyes. That is what I saw and what I thought of, and
I took it upon my conscience to absolve her from all guilt. I
set her free and promised her Paradise. She smiled at me
and grasped my hand, and before I could prevent her she had
kissed it. That was yesterday.”</p>

<p>Amadeus was silent. “That was yesterday,” he repeated,
after a long and meditative pause. “I did not go to-day, out
of fear of her dying. Perhaps she is dead even now.”</p>

<p>“If you still want to go, I am ready,” said Christian timidly.
“I’ll go with you. It’s only an hour’s walk.”</p>

<p>“Then let us go,” said Amadeus, with a sigh of relief, and
arose.</p>


<h3>XX</h3>

<p>An hour later they were in Borsche’s farm yard. The stable
door was open. The men servants and the maid servants stood
in front of it. An old man held a lantern high up, and they
all stared into the shed. In the dim and wavering light, their
faces showed a mixture of reverence and amazement. Within,
on a pallet of straw, lay the body of Walpurga. Its cheeks
were rosy. Nothing in that countenance recalled death, but
only a peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>On the wooden bench a single candle was burning; but it
was near extinction.</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss passed through that group of men and women,
and kneeled at the dead woman’s feet. The old man who held
the lantern whispered something, and all the men and women
kneeled down and folded their hands.</p>

<p>A cow lowed. After that there was no sound save from the
bells of the unquiet cattle. The darkness of the stable, the
face of the dead woman, which was like a face in a painting, the
faces of the kneeling people, with their blunted foreheads and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
hard lips, in the yellow glimmer of the light&mdash;all these things
Christian beheld, and something melted in his breast.</p>

<p>He himself watched it all from the darkness of the yard
behind.</p>

<p>When Amadeus Voss joined Christian, the village carpenter
came to measure the dead woman for her coffin. They started
on their homeward way in silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly Christian stopped. It was near a tall mile-post.
He grasped the post with both hands, and bent his head far
back, and gazed with the utmost intensity into the drifting
clouds of the night. Then he heard Amadeus Voss say: “Is
it possible? Can such things be?”</p>

<p>Christian turned to him.</p>

<p>“I have a strange feeling in your presence, Christian
Wahnschaffe,” Voss said in a repressed and toneless voice.
And then he murmured to himself: “Is it possible? Can the
monstrous and incredible come to pass?”</p>

<p>Christian did not answer, and they wandered on.</p>


<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>Crammon gave a dinner. Not in his own house; meetings
of a certain character were impossible there, on account of the
innocent presence of the two old maiden ladies, Miss Aglaia
and Miss Constantine. The disillusion would have been too
saddening and final to the good ladies, who were as convinced
of the virtue of their lord and protector as they were of the
emperor’s majesty.</p>

<p>In former years it had indeed sometimes seemed to them that
their adored one did not always tread the paths of entire
purity. They had closed an eye. Now, however, the dignity
and intellectual resonance of his personality forbade any doubt.</p>

<p>Crammon had invited his guests to the private dining-room
of a well-known hotel, in which he was familiar and esteemed.
The company consisted of several young members of the nobility,
to whom he was under social obligations, and, as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
ladies, there were three beauties, entertaining, elegant, and yielding,
in the precise degree which the occasion required. Crammon
called them his friends, but in his treatment of them there
was something languid and even vexed. He gave them clearly
to understand that he was only the business manager of the
feast, and that his heart was very far away.</p>

<p>No one, in fact, was present to whom he was not completely
indifferent. Best of all he liked the old pianist with long, grey
locks, who closed his eyes and smiled dreamily whenever he
played a melancholy or languishing piece, just as he had done
twenty years ago, when Crammon was still fired by the dreams
and ambitions of youth. He gave the old man sweets and
cigarettes, and sometimes patted his shoulder affectionately.</p>

<p>The table groaned under its burden of food and wine. Pepper
was added to the champagne to heighten every one’s thirst.
There were cherries in the fruit bowls, and the gentlemen found
it amusing to drop the pits down the semi-exposed bosoms of
the ladies. The latter found it easier and easier, as the
evening advanced, to resist the law of gravitation, and to display
their charming shoes and the smooth silks and rustling
laces of their legs in astonishingly horizontal attitudes. The
most agile among them, a popular soubrette, climbed on the
grand piano, and, accompanied by the grey-haired musician,
sang the latest hit of the music halls.</p>

<p>The young men joined in the chorus.</p>

<p>Crammon applauded with just two fingers. “There is a
sting in my soul,” he whispered into the din. He got up and
left the room.</p>

<p>In the corridor the head-waiter Ferdinand was leaning alone
and somewhat wearily against the frame of a mirror. A tender
intimacy of two decades bound Crammon to this man, who had
never in his life been indiscreet, in spite of the innumerable
secrets he had overheard.</p>

<p>“Bad times, Ferdinand,” Crammon said. “The world is
going to the deuce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“One must take things as they are, Herr von Crammon,”
that dignified individual consoled him, and handed him the
bill.</p>

<p>Crammon sighed. He gave directions that if his guests
inquired after him, they were to be told that he was indisposed
and had gone home.</p>

<p>“There is a sting in my soul,” he said, when he found himself
on the street. He determined to travel again.</p>

<p>He yearned for his friend. It seemed to him that he had
had no friend but that one who had cast him off.</p>

<p>He yearned for Ariel. It seemed to him that he had possessed
no woman, because she had not yielded to him who was
his very conception of genius and beauty.</p>

<p>At the door of his house stood Miss Aglaia. She had heard
him coming and had hastened to meet him. It frightened
Crammon, for the hour was late.</p>

<p>“There is a lady in the drawing-room,” Miss Aglaia whispered.
“She arrived at eight, and has been waiting since
then. She besought us so movingly to let her stay that we had
not the heart to refuse. She is a distinguished lady, and she
has a dear face&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Did she tell you her name?” Crammon asked, and the
thunder-clouds gathered on his brow.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“People who enter my dwelling are required to give their
names,” Crammon roared. “Is this a railway station or a
public shelter? Go in and ask her who she is. I shall wait
here.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes Miss Aglaia returned and said in a compassionate
tone: “She’s fallen asleep in an armchair. But
you can take a peep at her. I’ve left the door ajar.”</p>

<p>On tip-toes Crammon passed through the hall, and peered
into the well-lit drawing-room. He recognized the sleeper at
once. It was Elise von Einsiedel. She slept with her head
leaned back and inclining a little to one side. Her face was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
pale, with blue circles under her eyes, and her left arm hung
down limply.</p>

<p>Crammon stood there in his hat and overcoat, and gazed
at her with sombre eyes. “Unhappy child!” he murmured.</p>

<p>He closed the door with all possible precaution. Then he
drew Miss Aglaia toward the door and said: “The presence of
a strange lady makes it unseemly, of course, for me to pass the
night here. I shall find a bed elsewhere. I hope you appreciate
my attitude.”</p>

<p>Miss Aglaia was speechless over such purity and sternness.
Crammon continued: “As early as possible in the morning,
pack my bags and bring them to meet me in time to catch
the express to Ostende. And let Constantine come with you,
so that I may say good-bye to her as well. Let the strange
lady stay here as long as she desires. Entertain her courteously
and fulfil all her wishes. She has a sorrow, and deserves
kindness. If she asks after me, tell her that urgent affairs
require my presence elsewhere.”</p>

<p>He went out. Sadly, and quite astonished, Miss Aglaia looked
after him. “Good-night, Aglaia,” he called out once more.
Then the door closed behind him.</p>


<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>During the last days of April Christian received a telegram
from Eva Sorel. The message read: “From the third to the
twentieth of May, Eva Sorel will be at the Hotel Adlon, Berlin,
and feels quite sure that Christian Wahnschaffe will meet her
there.”</p>

<p>Christian read the message over and over. In his inner and
in his outer life all circumstances pointed to an approaching
crisis. He knew that this summons would be decisive in its
influence upon his fate. Its exact character and the extent of
its power he could not predict.</p>

<p>For weeks there had been a restlessness in him that robbed
him of sleep during many long hours of the night. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
certain days he had called for his motor in order to drive to
some near-by city. When the car had covered half the distance,
he ordered his chauffeur to turn back.</p>

<p>He had gone to Waldleiningen, and had patted his horses
and played with his dogs. But he had suddenly felt like a
schoolboy who lies and plays truant, and his pleasure in the
animals had gone. At parting he had put his arms about his
favourite dog, a magnificent Great Dane, and as he looked into
the animal’s eyes it had seemed to Christian, still in his character
of a truant, that he wanted to say: “I must first go
and pass my examination.” And the dog seemed to answer:
“I understand that. You must go.”</p>

<p>Also the slender horse of Denis Lay had said, with a turn
of its excessively graceful neck: “I understand that. You
must go.”</p>

<p>It was settled that the horse was to run in the races at
Baden-Baden, and the Irish jockey was full of confidence.
But on the day of his departure Christian was told that the
animal had sickened again. He thought: “I have loved it too
insistently. Now it wants the caressing hand, and is lonely
without it.”</p>

<p>With the coming of spring guests from the cities had
appeared almost daily at Christian’s Rest. But he had rarely
received any one. A single guest he could not bear at all. If
there were two they could address each other and make his
silence easier.</p>

<p>One day came Conrad von Westernach and Count Prosper
Madruzzi, bringing messages from Crammon. They were on
their way to Holland. Christian asked them to dine with him,
but he was very laconic. Conrad von Westernach remarked
later, in his forthright fashion, to Madruzzi: “That fellow has
a damned queer smile. You never know whether he’s a born
fool or whether he’s laughing at you.”</p>

<p>“It’s true,” the count agreed; “you never know where you
are with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>


<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>Christian had given his valet orders to prepare for his journey.
Then he had gone to the green-houses to interview the
gardeners. In the meantime twilight had set in. It had rained
all day, and the trees were still dripping. But now the fresh
greenery gleamed against the afterglow, and the windows of
the beautiful house were dipped in gold.</p>

<p>“Herr Voss is in the library,” an old footman announced.</p>

<p>Christian had begged Amadeus Voss to use the library quite
freely, whether he himself was at home or not. The servants
had been instructed. Voss had offered to catalogue the library,
but as yet he had made no beginning. He merely passed from
book to book, and if one interested him he read it and forgot
the passage of time.</p>

<p>The afterglow fell into the library too. Voss had taken
fifty or sixty volumes from the shelves, and he was now arranging
them in stacks on a large oak table.</p>

<p>“Why do you do that, Amadeus?” Christian asked carelessly.</p>

<p>“If you give me your permission, I’d like to burn these,”
Amadeus Voss answered.</p>

<p>Christian was surprised. “Why?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Because I lust after an <i>auto-da-fé</i>. It is worthless and
corrupt stuff, the product of idle and slothful minds. Don’t
you scent the poison of it in the atmosphere?”</p>

<p>“No, I scent nothing,” said Christian, more absent-mindedly
than ever. “But burn them if it amuses you,” he answered.</p>

<p>Amadeus had been in the library since three o’clock that
afternoon, and he had had a remarkable experience there. In
looking about among the shelves he had come upon a bundle
of letters. By some accident it had probably fallen behind
the books and been lost sight of. He had read a few lines of
the topmost letter, and from the first words there breathed
upon him the glow of an impassioned soul. Then he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
yielded to the temptation of untying the package. He had
taken the letters into a corner, and read them swiftly and
with fevered eyes.</p>

<p>A few bore dates. The whole series had been written about
two years before. They were signed merely by the initial F.
But in every word, in every image, in every turn of speech
there was such a fullness of love and devotion and adoration and
self-abnegation, and so wild and at the same time so spiritual
a stream of tenderness and pain, of happiness and yearning,
that Amadeus Voss seemed to glide from a world of shadows
and appearances into a far more real one. Yet in that, too,
all was but feigned and represented to lure and madden him.</p>

<p>And F.&mdash;this unknown, eloquent, radiant, profoundly moved
and nameless woman&mdash;where was she now? What had she
done with her love? Pressed flowers lay between certain
pages. Was the hand that plucked them withered as they?
And what had he done with her love, he whom she had wooed
so humbly and who was so riotous a spendthrift of great
gifts? He had been only twenty. He had probably taken as
a pastime all that was the fate of this full heart, and had
used it and trampled it in a consciousness of wealth that
neither counts nor reckons.</p>

<p>Deeper and deeper, as he read, a spear penetrated into the
breast of Amadeus. The Telchines gained power over him.
He turned pale and crimson. His fingers trembled, and his
mouth shrivelled in dryness, and his head seemed to be full
of needles. Had Christian entered then, he would have flung
himself upon him in foaming hatred, to throttle or to stab him.
Here was the unattainable, the eternally closed door. And a
demon had hurled him down before it.</p>

<p>He sat long in dull brooding. Then he looked about furtively,
and dropped the letters into his pocket. And then there
arose in him the desire to destroy, to annihilate something.
He chose books as sacrifices, and awaited Christian’s coming
with repressed excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s practically all contemporary trash,” he said drily, and
pointed to the books. “Stories like tangled thread, utterly
confused, without beginning or end. If you’ve read one page,
you know a thousand. There are descriptions of manners
with a delight in what is common and mean. The emotions
riot like weeds, and the style is so noisy that you lose all perception.
Love, love, love! That’s one theme. And the other
is wretchedness! There are histories and memoirs, too. Sheer
gossip! The poems are empty rhymings by people with inflated
egos. There’s popular philosophy&mdash;self-righteous twaddle. A
sincere parson’s talk were more palatable. What is it for?
Reading is a good thing, if a real spirit absorbs me, and I
forget and lose myself in it. But the unspiritual has neither
honesty nor imagination; he is a thief and a swindler.”</p>

<p>“Burn it, burn it!” Christian repeated, and sat down at
the other side of the room.</p>

<p>Amadeus went to the marble fire-place, which was so large
that a man could easily have lain down in it, and opened the
gates of brass. Then he carried the books there&mdash;one pile
after another, and heaped them on the flat stones. When he
had thrown them all in, he set fire to the pages of one book,
and lowered his head and watched the flames spread.</p>

<p>“You know that I am going to leave Christian’s Rest,”
Christian said, turning to him. It had grown quite dark
now.</p>

<p>Voss nodded.</p>

<p>“I don’t know for how long,” Christian continued. “It
may be very long before I return.”</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss said nothing.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do, Amadeus?” Christian asked
him.</p>

<p>Voss shrugged his shoulders. Involuntarily he pressed his
hand against the inner pocket in which lay the letters of the
unknown woman.</p>

<p>“It is dark and oppressive in the forester’s house,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Christian. “Won’t you come and live here? I’ll give the
necessary orders at once.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make me a beggar with your alms, Christian Wahnschaffe,”
Voss answered. “If you were to give me the house,
with all its forests and gardens, you would but rob me, and
leave me poorer by so much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand that,” said Christian.</p>

<p>Voss walked up and down. The carpet muffled his sturdy
tread.</p>

<p>“You are far too passionate, Amadeus,” Christian said.</p>

<p>Amadeus stopped in front of a lectern that had been placed
in a niche. Upon it lay the great Bible that Christian had
bought. It was open. The flames of the burning books flared
so brightly that he could read the words. For a space he read
in silence. Then he took the book, and going nearer to the
fire, sat down opposite Christian, and read aloud:</p>

<p>“Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart
cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways
of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou
that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.”</p>

<p>At the word, God, the almost unemphatic voice sounded
like a bell.</p>

<p>“Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while
the evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou
shalt say, I have no pleasure in them; while the sun, or the
light, or the moon, or the stars be not darkened, nor the clouds
return after the rain: In the day when the keepers of the
house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves,
and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that
look out of the windows be darkened, and the doors shall be
shut in the streets; when the sound of the grinding is low, and
he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters
of music shall be brought low; also when they shall be afraid
of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the
almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
burden and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long
home, and the mourners go about the street: or ever the silver
cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher
be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the
cistern.”...</p>

<p>He stopped. Christian, who had seemed scarcely to listen,
had arisen and come nearer to the fire. Now he sat down on
the floor, with his legs crossed under him, and gazed with a
serene wonder into the flames.</p>

<p>“How beautiful is fire!” he said softly.</p>

<p>Speechlessly Amadeus Voss regarded him. Then he spoke
quite suddenly. “Let me go with you, Christian Wahnschaffe.”</p>

<p>Christian did not take his eyes from the fire.</p>

<p>“Let me go with you,” Voss said more insistently. “It is
possible that you may need me: it is certain that without you
I am lost. Darkness is in me and a demon. You alone break
the spell. I do not know why it is thus, but it is. Let me go
with you.”</p>

<p>Christian replied: “Very well, Amadeus, you shall stay with
me. I want some one to stay with me.”</p>

<p>Amadeus grew pale, and his lips quivered.</p>

<p>Christian said: “How beautiful is fire!”</p>

<p>And Amadeus murmured: “It devours uncleanness and
remains clean.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE NAKED FEET</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> her companion, Fräulein Stöhr, the Countess Brainitz
travelled about the world.</p>

<p>She had been the guest of an incredibly aged Princess Neukirch
at Berchtesgaden. But she grew to be immensely bored,
and fled to Venice, Ravenna, and Florence. Armed with a
Baedeker, and accompanied by a guide, she “did” the galleries,
churches, basilicas, palaces, sarcophagi, and monuments,
and her tirelessness reduced Fräulein Stöhr to despair.</p>

<p>She quarrelled with the gondoliers over their fare, with
waiters over a tip, with shopkeepers over the price of their
wares. She thought every coin a counterfeit, and in her terror
of dirt and infection she touched no door-knob or chair, no
newspaper and no one’s hand. She washed herself repeatedly,
screeched uninterruptedly, and by her appetite struck her companions
at the table d’hôte with awe.</p>

<p>With rancour in her heart she left the land of miracles
and of petty fraud. She visited her nephews, the brothers
Stojenthin, in Berlin. They were charmed at her coming,
and borrowed a thousand marks of her over the oysters and
champagne. Then she proceeded to Stargard, to be with her
sisters Hilde Stojenthin and Else von Febronius.</p>

<p>She was vastly amused at the middle-class ladies in Stargard,
who curtsied to her as to a queen. At their teas she
lorded it over them from the heights of a sofa covered with
dotted calico. She entertained her devoutly attentive audience
with stories of the great world. At times these anecdotes were
of such a character that the judge’s widow had to administer
a warning pinch to the arm of her noble sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Frau von Febronius had been ailing since the beginning of
winter. Careless exposure on a sleigh drive had brought on
an attack of pneumonia. The consequences threatened to be
grave. The countess, who not only feared illness for herself
but hated it in others, grew restive and talked of leaving.</p>

<p>“When my dear husband saw his end approaching, he sent
me to Mentone,” she told Fräulein Stöhr. “Stupid and devoid
of understanding as he was&mdash;though not more so than most
men&mdash;in this respect he showed a praiseworthy delicacy of
feeling. I was simply not made to bear the sight of suffering.
Charity is not among my gifts.”</p>

<p>Fräulein Stöhr assumed a pastoral expression and cast her
eyes to heaven. She knew her mistress sufficiently to realize
that the anecdote of the dying count and the expedition to
Mentone was a product of the imagination. She said: “Man
should prepare himself in time for his latter end, Madame.”</p>

<p>The countess was indignant. “My dear Stöhr, spare me
your spiritual wisdom! It suits only times of trouble. Pastoral
consolations are not to my taste. It is not your proper
task to preach truths to me, but to offer me agreeable illusions.”</p>

<p>One evening Frau von Febronius asked to see the countess.
The latter went. But terror made her pale. She put on a hat,
swathed her face in a veil and her hands in gloves. Sighing
she sat down beside her sister’s bed, and carefully measured
the distance, so as to be out of reach of the patient’s breath.</p>

<p>Frau von Febronius smiled indulgently. Her illness had
smoothed the lines of petty care and sorrow from her face,
and, among her white pillows, she looked strikingly like her
daughter Letitia. “I’m sorry to trouble you, Marion,” she
began, “but I must talk to you. There’s something that weighs
on my mind, and I must confide in some one. The fact in
question should be told to one who knows me, and should not
be buried with me.”</p>

<p>“I beseech you, Elsie, my poor darling, don’t talk of graves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and such things,” the countess exclaimed in a whining voice.
“My appetite will be gone for a week. If you’ll only fling the
medicine bottles out of the window, and tell all quacks to go
to the devil, you’ll be well by day after to-morrow. And, for
heaven’s sake, don’t make a confession. It reminds one of
quite dreadful things.”</p>

<p>But Frau von Febronius went on: “It’s no use, Marion.
I must tell you this. The reason I turn to you is because
you’ve really been so very good and kind to Letitia, and
because Hilde, sensible and faithful as she is, wouldn’t quite
understand. Her notions are too conventional.”</p>

<p>In whispers she now related the story of Letitia’s birth. An
illness of his earlier years had deprived her husband of the hope
of posterity; but he had yearned for a son, a child. This
yearning had finally silenced all scruples and all contradictory
emotions to such an extent that he had chosen a congenial
stranger to continue his race. He had persuaded her, his
wife, whom he loved above all things, after a long struggle.
Finally she had yielded to his unheard-of demand. But when
the child was born, a progressive melancholy had seized upon
her husband. It had become incurable, and under its control
he had ruined his estate and in the end himself. He had felt
nothing of the happiness he had expected. He had, on the
contrary, always shown a contemptuous dislike of Letitia, and
had avoided her as far as possible.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t surprise me a bit,” the countess remarked.
“You were uncommonly naïve to be astonished. A strange
child is a strange child, no matter how it got into the nest.
But it’s really like a fairy tale. I confess I underestimated
you. Such delightful sophistication! And who is the child’s
father? Who is responsible for the life of that darling angel?
He deserves great credit for his achievement.”</p>

<p>Frau von Febronius mentioned the name. The countess
screamed, and leaped up as though she had been stung.
“Crammon? Bernard von Crammon?” She clasped her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
hands in agony. “Is that true? Aren’t you dreaming?
Consider, my dear! It must be the fever. Oh, certainly, it’s
sheer delirium. Take a little water, I beg of you, and then
think carefully, and stop talking nonsense.”</p>

<p>Frau von Febronius gazed at her sister in utter amazement.
“Do you know him?” she asked.</p>

<p>The countess’ voice was bitter. “Do I know him? I do.
And tell me one more thing: Does this&mdash;this&mdash;creature know?
Has he always known?”</p>

<p>“He knows. Two years ago he saw Letitia at our old
home. Since that time he has known. But you act as if he
were the fiend incarnate, Marion. Did you have a quarrel with
him or what? You always exaggerate so!”</p>

<p>Excitedly the countess walked up and down. “He knows
it, the wretch! He has always known it, the rogue! And such
dissembling as he has practised! Such hypocrisy! The
wretched rogue, I’ll bring it home to him! I’ll seek him out!”
She turned to her sister. “Forgive me, Elsie, for letting my
temperament run away with me. You are right. His name
awakened an anger of some years’ standing. My blood boils,
I confess. He may have been a man of honour and a gentleman
in his youth. He must have been, or you would never
have consented to such an adventure. But I hesitate to say
what he is to-day. He is still perfectly discreet; you need
have no anxiety on that score. But I assert that even discretion
has its limits. Where these are passed, decent people
shake their heads, and virtue looks like mere baseness. <i>Voilà.</i>”</p>

<p>“All that you say is quite dark to me,” Frau von Febronius
replied wearily, “and I really haven’t any desire to fathom it.
I wanted to tell you this oppressive secret. Keep it to yourself.
Never reveal it, except to prevent some misfortune, or
to render Letitia a service. I don’t quite see how either purpose
will ever be served by a revelation. But it consoles me
that one other human being, beside myself and that man, knows
the truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The countess gazed thoughtfully at her sister. “Your life
wasn’t exactly a gay one, was it, Elsie?”</p>

<p>The sick woman answered: “No, hardly gay.”</p>

<p>During the following days she rallied a little. Then came
a relapse that left no room for hope. In the middle of March
she died.</p>

<p>By this time the countess was already far away. Her goings
and comings were as purposeless as ever. But she nursed a
favourite vision now. Some day she would meet Crammon,
confront him with her knowledge, avenge herself upon him,
challenge him and annihilate him, in a word, enjoy a rich triumph.
At times when she was alone, or even in the presence
of Miss Stöhr, whom it astonished, she would suddenly wrinkle
her childlike forehead, clench her little fists, and her shiny
face would turn red as a lobster, and her violet-blue eyes blaze
as for battle.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was three o’clock in the morning when Felix Imhof left
a party in the Leopoldstrasse, where there had been gaming for
high stakes. He had won several thousand marks, and the
gold coins clinked in the overcoat pocket into which he had
carelessly stuffed them.</p>

<p>He had had a good deal to drink, too. His head was a bit
heavy. At his first steps into the fresh air he reeled a little.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he was in no mood to go home. So he wandered
into a coffee-house that was frequented by artists. He
thought he might still find a few people with whom he could
chat and argue. The day he had passed was not yet full
enough of life for him. He wanted it brimming.</p>

<p>In the room, which was blue with smoke, there were only
two men, the painter Weikhardt, who had recently returned
from Paris, and another painter, who looked rather ragged and
stared dejectedly at the table.</p>

<p>Felix Imhof joined the two. He ordered cognac and served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
them, but, to his annoyance, the conversation would not get
started. He got up and invited Weikhardt to walk with him.
With contemptuous joviality he turned to the other: “Well,
you old paint-slinger, your lamp seems about burned out!”</p>

<p>The man didn’t stir. Weikhardt shrugged his shoulders,
and said softly: “He has no money for bread and no place
to sleep.”</p>

<p>Felix Imhof plunged his hand into his pocket, and threw
several gold coins on the table. The painter looked up. Then
he gathered the gold. “Hundred and sixty marks,” he said
calmly. “Pay you back on the first.”</p>

<p>Imhof laughed resoundingly.</p>

<p>When they were in the street, Weikhardt said good-naturedly:
“He believes every word of it. If he didn’t absolutely
believe it, he wouldn’t have taken the money. There are
still eleven days before the first&mdash;time for a world of illusions.”</p>

<p>“It may be that he believes it,” Imhof replied, with an
unsteady laugh, “it may be. He even believes that he exists,
and yet he’s nothing but a melancholy corpse. O you painters,
you painters!” he cried out into the silent night. “You have
no feeling for life. Paint life! You’re still sitting by a spinning-wheel,
instead of at some mighty wheel of steel, propelled
by a force of sixteen thousand horse-power. Paint my age
for me, my huge delight in being! Smell, taste, see, and grasp
that colossus! Make me feel that great rhythm, create my
grandiose dreams. Give me life&mdash;my life and its great affirmation!”</p>

<p>Weikhardt said drily: “I have heard that talk before&mdash;between
midnight and dawn. When the cock crows we all
calm down again, and every man pulls the cart to which fate
has hitched him.”</p>

<p>Imhof stopped, and somewhat theatrically laid his hand on
Weikhardt’s shoulder. He gazed at him with his intensely
black, bloodshot eyes. “I give you a commission herewith,
Weikhardt,” he said. “You have talent. You’re the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
one with a mind above your palette. Paint my portrait. I
don’t care what it costs&mdash;twenty, fifty thousand. Doesn’t
matter. Take your own time&mdash;two months, or two years. But
show me&mdash;me&mdash;the innermost me. Take this vulture’s nose,
this Hapsburg lip, these gorilla arms and spindle shanks, this
coat and this chapeau claque, and drag from it all the animating
Idea. To hell with the accidents of my phiz, which looks
as though an unskilful potter had bungled it in the making.
Render my ambition, my restlessness, my inner tempo and
colourfulness, my great hunger and the time-spirit that is in
me. But you must hurry; for I am self-consumed. In a few
years I shall have burned out. My soul is tinder. Render this
process with the divine objectivity of art, and I’ll reward you
like a Medici. But I must be able to see the flame, the flaring
up, the dying down, the quiver of it! I want to see it, even
if to make me see it you have to lash the whole tradition since
Raphael and Rubens into rags!”</p>

<p>“You are an audacious person,” Weikhardt said, in his dry
way. “But have patience with us, and restrain your admiration
for your particular century. I do not let the age overwhelm
me to the point of folly. I do not share the reverential
awe of speed and machinery that has seized upon many young
men like a new form of epilepsy. I haven’t any attitude
of adoration toward seven-league boots, express trains, dreadnoughts,
and inflated impressionism. I seek my gods elsewhere.
I don’t believe I’m the painter you’re looking for.
Where were you? You’ve been travelling again?”</p>

<p>“I’m always on some road,” Felix Imhof replied. “It’s a
crazy sort of life. Let me tell you how I spent the last five
days. Monday night I went to Leipzig. Tuesday morning
at nine I had a conference with some literary people in regard
to the founding of a new review. Splendid fellows&mdash;keen critics
and intellectual Jacobins, every one of them. Then I went
to an exhibition of majolicas. Bought some charming things.
At noon I left for Hamburg. On the train I read two manu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>scripts
and a drama, all by a young genius who’ll startle the
world. That evening attended a meeting of the directorate
of the East African Development Corporation. Festivities
till late that night. Slept two hours, then proceeded to Oldenburg
to a reunion of the retired officers of my old regiment.
Talked, drank, and even danced, though the party was stag.
Six o’clock in the morning rushed to Quackenbruck, a shabby
little country town on the moors, where the officers had arranged
for a little horse race. My beast was beaten by a head.
Drove to the station and took a train for Berlin. Attended to
business next morning in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
interviewed agents, witnessed a curious operation in the clinic,
made a flying-trip to Johannisthal, where a new aeroplane was
tried out; went to the Deutsches Theater that evening, and
saw a marvellous performance of ‘Peer Gynt.’ Drank the
night away with the actors. Next morning Dresden. Conference
with two American friends. Home to-day. Next week
won’t be very different, nor the one after that. I ought to
sleep more; that’s the only thing.” He waved his thick bamboo
cane in air.</p>

<p>“It is enough to frighten any one,” said Weikhardt, who
took more comfort in the contrast between his own phlegm
and his companion’s excitement. “How about your wife?
What does she say to your life? She was pointed out to me
recently. She doesn’t look as if she would let herself be pushed
aside.”</p>

<p>Imhof stopped again. He stood there, with his legs far
apart and his trunk bent forward, and rested on his cane.
“My wife!” he said. “What a sound that has! I have a
wife. Ah, yes. I give you my word, my dear man, I should
have clean forgotten it to-night, if you hadn’t reminded me.
It’s not her fault, to be sure. She’s a born Wahnschaffe; that
means something! But somehow.... God knows what it
is&mdash;the damned rush and hurry, I suppose. You’re quite right.
She’s not the sort to be neglected or pushed to the wall. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
creates her own spaces, and within these”&mdash;he described
great circles in the air with his cane&mdash;“she dwells, cool to her
fingertips, tense as a wire of steel. A magnificent character&mdash;energetic,
but with a strong sense for decorative effects. She’s
to be respected, my dear man.”</p>

<p>Weikhardt had no answer ready for this outburst. Its
mixture of boasting and irony, cynicism and ecstatic excitement
disarmed and wearied him at once. They had reached
a side street, which led to the Englischer Garten, and in which
stood the painter’s little house. He wanted to say good-night.
But Imhof, who seemed still unwilling to be alone, asked:
“Are you working at anything?”</p>

<p>Weikhardt hesitated before answering. That was enough
to make Imhof accompany him. The sky grew grey with dawn.</p>

<p>Felix Imhof recited softly to himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Where the knights repose, and streaming</div>
       <div class="verse">Banners fold at last their gleaming,</div>
       <div class="verse">Towers rise to the way-farers,</div>
       <div class="verse">And the wanderers seek a spring;</div>
       <div class="verse">And the lovely water-bearers</div>
       <div class="verse">Lift a goblet to the dreaming</div>
       <div class="verse">Shadow of the fleeing king.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Weikhardt, who would not yield to Imhof in a knowledge or
love of the poet Stefan George, continued the quotation in a
caressing voice:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“With a smile serene he watches,</div>
       <div class="verse">Yet flits on with shyer seeming,</div>
       <div class="verse">For beneath him fades the height,</div>
       <div class="verse">And he fears all mortal touches,</div>
       <div class="verse">And he almost dreads the light.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>They entered the studio. Weikhardt lit the lamp, and let
its glow fall upon a picture that was not quite completed. It
was a Descent from the Cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rather old-fashioned, isn’t it?” Weikhardt asked, with
a sly smile. He had grown pale.</p>

<p>Imhof looked. He was a connoisseur through and through.
No other had his eye. The painters knew it.</p>

<p>The picture, which reminded one of the visionary power as
well as of the brushwork of El Greco, was bizarre in composition,
intense in movement, and filled with an ecstatic passion.
The forms of an old master, through which the painter had
expressed himself, were but an appearance. The vision had
been flung upon the canvas with a burning splendour. The
figures had nothing old-fashioned about them; there was no
<i>cliché</i>; they were like clouds, and the clouds like architecture.
There were no concrete things. There was a chaos, which drew
meaning and order only from the concentrated perceptions of
the beholder.</p>

<p>Felix Imhof folded his hands. “To have such power,” he
murmured. “Great God, to have the power to project such
things!”</p>

<p>Weikhardt lowered his head. He attributed little significance
to these words. A few days before he had stood in
front of his canvas, and he had imagined that a peasant was
standing beside him&mdash;an old peasant or any other simple man
of the people. And it had seemed to him that this peasant,
this humble man, who knew nothing of art, had kneeled down
to pray. Not from piety, but because what he saw had in its
own character overwhelmed him.</p>

<p>Almost rudely Imhof turned to the painter and said: “The
picture is mine. Under all circumstances. Mine. I must
have it. Good-night.” With his top hat set at a crazy angle,
and his sleepless, dissipated face, he was a vision to frighten
one.</p>

<p>At last he went home.</p>

<p>Next day Crammon informed him of his arrival in Munich.
He had come because Edgar Lorm was about to give a series
of performances there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Christian considered how he could convey money to Amadeus
Voss without humiliating him. Since it was agreed that they
travel together, it was necessary for Voss to have the proper
outfit; and he possessed nothing but what he had on.</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss understood the situation. The social abyss
yawned between them. Both men gazed helplessly into it, one
on each shore.</p>

<p>In his own heart Voss mocked at the other’s weakness, and
at the same time loved him for his noble shame&mdash;loved him
with that emotional self that had been humiliated, estranged
from the world, stamped on and affronted from his youth on.
He shuddered at the prospect of sitting in the forester’s house
again with perished hopes and empty hands, and letting his
soul bleed to death from the wounds of unattainable lures. He
brooded, regarding Christian almost with hatred. What will
he do? How will he conquer the difficulty?</p>

<p>Time passed. The matter was urgent.</p>

<p>On the last afternoon Christian said: “The hours crawl.
Let us play cards.” He took a pack of French cards from a
drawer.</p>

<p>“I haven’t touched a card in my life,” Voss said.</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” Christian replied. “All you need
do is to tell red from black. I’ll keep the bank. Bet on a
colour. If you’ve bet on red and I turn up red, you’ve
won. How much will you risk? Let us start with one
taler.”</p>

<p>“Very well, here it is,” said Voss, and put the silver coin
on the table. Christian shuffled the cards and drew one. It
was red.</p>

<p>“Risk your two talers now,” Christian advised. “Novices
have luck.”</p>

<p>Voss won the two talers. The betting continued. Once or
twice he lost. But finally he had won thirty talers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now you take the bank,” Christian proposed. He was
secretly pleased that his ruse was working so well.</p>

<p>He bet ten talers and lost. Then fifteen, then twenty, then
thirty, and lost again. He risked a hundred marks, two hundred,
five hundred, more and more, and still lost. Voss’s cheeks
turned hectic red, then white as chalk: his hands trembled,
his teeth rattled. He was seized by a terror that his luck
would change, but he was incapable of speech or of asking for
an end of the game. The bank notes were piled up in front
of him. In half an hour he had won over four thousand marks.</p>

<p>Christian had previously marked the cards in a manner that
no inexperienced eye could detect. He knew exactly which
colour Voss would find. But the curious thing was that, though
he forgot occasionally to watch the markings, Voss still won.</p>

<p>Christian got up. “We’re in a hurry,” he said. “You must
get ready for our journey, Amadeus.”</p>

<p>Voss was overwhelmed by the change which had come over
his life within a few minutes. If a spark of suspicion glowed
in his soul, he turned away from it, and plunged into rich
dreams.</p>

<p>The motor took them to Wiesbaden, and there, with Christian’s
help, Amadeus bought garments and linen, boots, hats,
gloves, cravats, a razor, a manicure set, and a trunk.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock that evening they sat in the sleeper. “Who
am I now?” asked Amadeus Voss. He looked about him with
a curious and violent glance, and pushed the blond hair from
his forehead. “What do I represent now? Give me an office
and a title, Christian Wahnschaffe, in order that I may know
who I am.”</p>

<p>Christian watched the other’s excitement with quiet eyes.
“Why should you think yourself another to-night or changed
from yesterday?” he asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Eva Sorel passed through the countries of Europe&mdash;a comet
leaving radiance in its wake.</p>

<p>Her day was thickly peopled. It needed the flexibility of
an experienced practitioner to test and grant the many-sided
demands upon her. Monsieur Chinard, her impresario, served
admirably in this capacity. Only Susan Rappard treated
the man morosely. She called him a Figaro <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pris à la
retraite</i>.</p>

<p>In addition, the dancer employed a courier and a secretary.</p>

<p>Several of her adorers had been following her from city to
city for months. They were Prince Wiguniewski, a middle-aged
American, named Bradshaw, the Marquis Vicente Tavera,
of the Spanish legation at Petrograd, Herr Distelberg, a Jewish
manufacturer of Vienna, and Botho von Thüngen, a very
young Hanoverian, a student in his second year.</p>

<p>These, as well as others who drifted with the group from
time to time, neglected their callings, friends, and families.
They needed the air that Eva breathed in order to breathe
themselves. They had the patience of petitioners and the
optimism of children. They were envious of one another’s
advantage, knowledge, and witticisms. Each noted with malicious
delight if another blundered. They vied zealously for the
friendship of Susan, and made her costly presents, in order
that she might tell them what her mistress had said and done,
how she had slept, in what mood she had awakened, and when
she would receive.</p>

<p>Since Count Maidanoff had joined Eva’s circle they had all
been profoundly depressed. They knew, everybody knew, who
was concealed behind this pseudonym. Against him&mdash;mighty
and greatly feared&mdash;no one hoped to prevail.</p>

<p>Eva consoled them with a smile. They counted for nothing
in her eyes. “How are my chamberlains?” she asked Susan,
“how do my time-killers kill their time?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>But she was not quite as light and serene of soul as she had
once been.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>She had made the acquaintance of Count Maidanoff in Trouville.
She had been presented to him on the promenade, and
a far-flung circle of fashionables had looked on. Careful
murmurs had blended with the thunder of the sea.</p>

<p>She came home and grasped Susan by the shoulders. “Don’t
let me go out again,” she said, pale and breathing heavily. “I
don’t want to look into those eyes again. I must not meet
that man any more.”</p>

<p>Susan exhausted herself promising this. She did not know
who had awakened such horror in her mistress. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle est un
peu folle</span>,” she said to M. Labourdemont, the secretary, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mais
ce grain de folie est le meilleur de l’art.</span>”</p>

<p>The next day Count Maidanoff announced his formal call,
and had to be received.</p>

<p>The conventional act of homage, to which he was entitled
by his birth, he repaid with a personal and sincere one.</p>

<p>His speech was heavy and slow. He seemed to despise the
words, the use of which caused him such exertion. Sometimes
he stopped in the middle of a sentence and frowned in annoyance.
Between his eyebrows there were two straight, deep
lines that made his face permanently sombre. His smile began
with an upward curl of the lips, and quivered down into his
thin, colourless beard, like the effect of a muscular paralysis.</p>

<p>He went straight and without circumlocution toward his purpose.
It was commonly the office of his creatures to clear the
road toward his amatory adventures. By doing the wooing
himself in this instance he desired to single out its object by
an act of especial graciousness.</p>

<p>The cool timidity of the dancer had pleased him at first.
Fear was to him the most appealing quality in men. But Eva’s
repressed chill in the face of his courteous proposals confused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
him. His eyes became empty, he looked bored, and asked for
permission to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>He talked of Paris, of a singer at the Grand Opera there.
Then he became silent, and sat there like some one who has all
eternity ahead of him. When he arose and took his leave, he
looked as though he were really asleep.</p>

<p>With arms crossed Eva walked about the room till evening.
During the night she picked up books which she did not read,
thought of things that were indifferent to her, called Susan only
to torment her, wrote a letter to Ivan Becker and tore it up
again. Finally, in spite of the driving rain, she wrapped herself
in a cloak and went out on the terrace.</p>

<p>Maidanoff repeated his visit. At the inevitable point Eva
conveyed to him with great delicacy that his expectations were
doomed to disappointment. He looked at her with slothful,
oblique glances, and condescended to smile. What nonsense,
his morose frown seemed thereupon to say.</p>

<p>Suddenly he opened his eyes very wide. The effect was
uncanny. Eva bent her head forward in expectation, and
spread out her fingers.</p>

<p>He said: “You have the most beautiful hands I have ever
seen. To have seen them is to desire to know their touch.”</p>

<p>Three hours later she left Trouville, accompanied by Susan
and by M. Labourdemont, and travelled to Brussels, where
Ivan Becker was staying.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Becker lived in the suburbs, in a lonely house that stood
in a neglected garden. He received her in a tumbled room that
was as big as a public hall. Two candles burned on the table.</p>

<p>He looked emaciated, and moved about restlessly, even after
he had bidden Eva welcome.</p>

<p>She told him with some haste of her engagement in Russia,
which she was about to fulfil, and asked whether he had any
commissions to give her. He said that he had not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Grand Duke was attentive to me,” she said, and
looked at him expectantly.</p>

<p>He nodded. After a little he sat down and said: “I must
tell you a dream I had; or, rather, a hallucination, for I
lay with my eyes wide open. Listen!</p>

<p>“About a richly laid board there sat five or six young
women. They were in evening dress, with very deep décolletage,
and laughed wildly and drank champagne. With frivolous
plays on words and seductive gestures, they turned to
one who sat at the head of the table. But that one had no
form: he was like a lump of dough or clay. The footmen
trembled when they approached him, and the women grew
pale under their rouge when he addressed them. In the middle
of the gleaming cloth there lay, unnoticed by any one, a
corpse. It was covered with fruits, and from its breast, between
the peaches and the grapes, projected the handle of a dagger.
Blood trickled through the joints of the table and tapped in
dull drops on the carpet.</p>

<p>“The meal came to an end. All were in a wildly exuberant
mood. Then that formless one arose, grasped one of the
women, drew her close to him, and demanded music. And
while the thunderous music resounded, that lump expanded
and grew, and a skull appeared on it, and eyes within that
skull, and these eyes blazed in a measureless avidity. The
woman that he held became paler and paler, and sought to free
herself from his embrace. But long, thin arms grew out of his
trunk. And with these he pressed her so silently and so cruelly
that she began to moan and turn blue. And her body snapped
in two in the middle. Lifeless she lay in his arms, and nothing
seemed left of her but her dress. Then the corpse, that lay
with pierced breast amid the fruit and sweets, raised its head,
and said with closed eyes: ‘Give her back to me.’</p>

<p>“Suddenly many people streamed into that room&mdash;peasants
and factory workers, soldiers and ragged women, Jews and
Jewesses. An old man with a white beard said to the formless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
one: ‘Give me back my daughter.’ Others who stood behind
screamed frantically: ‘Give us our daughters, our brides, our
sisters.’ Then peasants pressed forward, and bent to the earth
their melancholy faces, and said: ‘Give us our lands and our
forests.’ Over all rose the piercing voices of mothers: ‘Give
us our sons, our sons.’ The formless one receded step by step
into empty space. But even as he receded he assumed a more
clearly defined shape. The face, the hands, and the garments
were brown as though encrusted with rust or dried slime.
The features of the face gave not the least notion of that
being’s character, and precisely this circumstance heightened
the despair of all beyond endurance. They cried without ceasing:
‘Our brothers! Our sons! Our sisters! Our lands!
Our forests, O thou accursed unto all eternity!’”</p>

<p>Eva said no word.</p>

<p>Ivan Becker rested his head upon his hand. “One thing is
certain. He has caused so many tears to be shed, that were
they gathered into one lake, that lake were deeper than the
Kremlin is tall; the blood that he has caused to flow would
be a sea in which all Moscow could be drowned.”</p>

<p>He walked to and fro a few times. Then he sat down again
and continued: “He is the creator and instigator of an incomparable
reign of terror. Our living souls are his victims. Wherever
there is a living soul among us, it becomes his prey. Six
thousand intellectuals were deported during the past year.
Where he sets his foot, there is death. Ruins and fields full of
murdered men mark his path. These expressions are not to be
taken metaphorically but quite, quite literally. It was he who
created the organization of the united nobility, which holds
the country in subjection, and is a modern instrument of torture
on the hugest scale. The pogroms, the murderous Finnish
expedition, the torturing of the imprisoned, the atrocities of the
Black Hundreds&mdash;all these are his work. He wastes untold
millions from the public treasury; he pardons the guilty and
condemns the innocent. He throttles the spirit of man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
extinguishes all light. He is all-powerful. He is God’s living
adversary. I bow before him.”</p>

<p>Eva looked up in astonishment. But Becker did not observe
her.</p>

<p>“There is no one who knows him. No one is able to see
through him. I believe he is satiated. Nothing affects him
any longer except some stimulus of the epidermis. The story
is told that sometimes he has two beautiful naked women
fight in his presence. They have daggers and must lacerate
each other. One must bow down before that.”</p>

<p>“I do not understand,” Eva whispered wide-eyed. “Why
bow?”</p>

<p>Becker shook his head warningly, and his monotonous voice
filled the room once more. “He has found everything between
heaven and earth to be for sale&mdash;friendship, love, the patience
of a people, justice, the Church, peace and war. First he commands
or uses force; that goes without saying. What these
cannot conquer he buys. It seems, to be sure, that pressure
and force can accomplish things that would defy and wreck
ordinary mortals. While hunting bears in the Caucasus his
greatest favourite, Prince Szilaghin, fell ill. His fever was high
and he was carried into the hut of some Circassians. Szilaghin,
by the way, is a creature of incredible corruption&mdash;only twenty
years old and of astonishing though effeminate beauty. To
win a bet he once disguised himself as a cocotte, and spent a
night in the streets and amusement resorts of Petrograd. In
the morning he brought back a handful of jewels, including a
magnificent bracelet of emeralds, that had been given him as
tributes to his mere beauty. It was he who fell ill in the mountains.
A mounted messenger was sent to the nearest village,
and dragged back with him an old, ignorant country doctor.
The Grand Duke pointed to his favourite writhing in delirium,
and said to the old man: ‘If he dies, you die too.’ Every hour
the physician administered a draught to the sick man. In
the intervals he kneeled trembling by the bed and prayed. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
fate would have it, Szilaghin recovered consciousness toward
morning, and gradually became well. The Grand Duke was
convinced that the inexorable alternative which he had offered
the old physician had released mysterious forces in him and
worked something like a miracle. Thus he does not feel nature
as a barrier to his power.”</p>

<p>A swift vividness came into Eva’s features. She got up and
walked to the window and opened it. A storm was shaking
the trees. The ragged clouds in the sky, feebly illuminated
by moonlight and arching the darkness, were like a picture of
Ruysdael. Without turning she said: “You say no one can
penetrate him. There is nothing to penetrate. There is an
abyss, dark and open.”</p>

<p>“It may be that you are right and that he is like an abyss,”
Ivan Becker answered softly, “but who will have the courage
to descend into it?”</p>

<p>Another silence fell upon them. “Speak, Ivan, speak out at
last the thought in your mind!” Eva cried out into the night.
And every fibre of her, from the tips of her hair to the hem of
her gown, was tense with listening.</p>

<p>But Becker did not answer. Only a terrible pallor came over
his face.</p>

<p>Eva turned around. “Shall I throw myself into his arms
in order to create a new condition in the world?” she asked
proudly and calmly. “Shall I increase his opinion of the
things that can be bought among men by the measure of my
worth? Or do you think that I could persuade him to exchange
the scaffold for the confessional and the hangman’s axe for a
flute?”</p>

<p>“I have not spoken of such a thing; I shall not speak of it,”
said Ivan Michailovitch with solemnly raised hand.</p>

<p>“A woman can do many things,” Eva continued. “She
can give herself away, she can throw herself away, she can sell
herself, she can conceal indifference and deny her hatred. But
against horror she is powerless; that tears the heart in two.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Show me a way; make me insensitive to the horror of it; and I
shall chain your tiger.”</p>

<p>“I know of no way,” answered Ivan Michailovitch. “I
know none, for horror is upon me too. May God, the Eternal,
enlighten you.”</p>

<p>The loneliness of the room, of the house, of the storm-ploughed
garden, became as the thunder of falling boulders.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Her friends awaited developments in suspense. None
expected her to offer Maidanoff any serious resistance. When
she seemed to hold out, her subtlety was admired. Paris predicted
a radiant future for her. Much public curiosity centred
upon her, and many newspaper columns were devoted
to her.</p>

<p>When she arrived in Russia it was clear that the authorities
and officials had received special instructions. No queen could
have been treated with more subtle courtesy. Palatial rooms
in a hotel were in readiness and adorned. A slavish humility
surrounded her.</p>

<p>When the Grand Duke called, she begged him to rescind the
orders that made her his debtor. He devoured her words
with a frosty and lurking expression, but remained inactive.
She was indignant at this slothfulness of a rigid will, this deaf
ear that listened so greedily.</p>

<p>His contempt of mankind had something devastating in it.
His slow eyes seemed to say: Man, thou slimy worm, grovel
and die!</p>

<p>In his presence Eva felt her thoughts to be so loud at times
that she feared he would perceive them.</p>

<p>She ventured to oppose and judge him. A young girl, Vera
Cheskov, had shot the governor of Petrograd. Eva had the
courage to praise that deed. The Grand Duke’s answer was
smooth, and he left quite unruffled. She challenged him more
vigorously. Her infinitely expressive body vibrated in rhythms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of bitterness and outrage. She melted in grief, rage, and
sympathy.</p>

<p>He watched her as one would watch a noble beast at its
graceful antics and said: “You are extraordinary, Madame.
I cannot tell what wish of yours I would leave ungranted for
the reward of winning your love.” He said that in a deep voice,
which was hoarse. He had also a higher voice, which had a
grinding sound like that of rusty hinges.</p>

<p>Eva’s shoulders quivered. His iron self-sufficiency reflected
no image of her or her influence. Against it all forces were
shattered.</p>

<p>Twice she saw him change countenance and give a start.
The first time was when she told him of her German descent.
An inbred hatred against all Germans and everything German
filled him. An evil mockery glared in his face. He determined
not to believe her and dropped the subject.</p>

<p>And the second time was when she spoke of Ivan Michailovitch
Becker. She could not help it; she had to bring that
name to the light. It was her symbol and talisman.</p>

<p>A glance like a whip’s lash leaped out of those slothful eyes.
The two deep grooves between the eyebrows stretched like the
antennæ of an insect. A diagonal groove appeared and formed
with the others a menacing cross. The face became ashen.</p>

<p>Susan was impatient. She urged her on and lured her on.
“Why do you hesitate?” she said to her mistress one evening.
“So near the peak one cannot go back. Remember our dreams
in Toledo! We thought they were insolent then. Reality puts
us to shame. Take what is given you. Never will your sweet,
little dancing feet win a greater prize.”</p>

<p>Eva walked in a circle about the rug. “Be quiet,” she said
thoughtfully and threateningly, “You don’t know what you are
advising me to do.”</p>

<p>Crouching near the fire-place, Susan’s lightless, plum-like
eyes followed her mistress. “Are you afraid?” she asked with
a frown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe I am afraid,” Eva replied.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the sculptor whom we visited in Meudon
last winter? He showed us his work, and you two talked art.
He said: ‘I mustn’t be afraid of the marble; the marble must
be afraid of me.’ You almost kissed him in gratitude for those
words. Don’t be afraid now. You are the stronger.”</p>

<p>Eva stood still, and sighed: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cette maladie, qu’on appelle
la sagesse!</span>”</p>

<p>Then Susan went to the piano-forte, and with her fluttering
angularity of movement began to play a Polonaise of Chopin.
Eva listened for a while. Then she went up to Susan from
behind, tapped her shoulder, and said, as the playing ceased,
with a dark, strange cooing in her voice:</p>

<p>“If it must be, I shall first live one summer of love, the like
of which has not been seen on earth. Do not speak, Susan.
Play on, and do not speak.”</p>

<p>Susan looked up, and shook her puzzled head.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>On the day of Eva’s last appearance in Petrograd, a well
laid high explosive mine blew up the central building of the
Agricultural Exposition.</p>

<p>The plot had been aimed at the person of the Grand Duke.
His visit had been expected, the order in which he would inspect
the buildings had been carefully mapped out. A slight maladjustment
in the machinery of his car delayed him and his
train a few minutes beyond the precisely fixed hour.</p>

<p>At the very moment when he put his foot on the first step
of the building, a terrific crash resounded. The sky disappeared
behind fume and fragments. Several manufacturers
and bureaucrats, who had officiously hurried ahead, as well as
ten or twelve workingmen, were killed. The air pressure
smashed the window panes in all the houses within a mile of
the spot.</p>

<p>For a while the Grand Duke stood quite still. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
curiosity or fear, but with an indescribably sombre look, he
surveyed the devastation. When he turned to go, the great
crowds who had streamed thither melted back silently at his
approach. They left him a broad path through which his
abnormally long legs, accompanied by the clinking of his sword,
strode with the steps of a sower.</p>

<p>For her final performance Eva had selected the rôle of the
fettered and then liberated Echo, in the pantomime called
The Awakening of Pan. It had always created enthusiasm;
but this time she celebrated an unparalleled triumph.</p>

<p>She danced a dance of freedom and redemption, that affected
with complete immediacy the nerves of the thronging audiences,
and released the tensions of the day of their lives. There was
a present and significant eloquence in the barbaric defiance,
the fiery terror of the pursued. Then came her sudden rallying,
her heroic determination, her grief over a first defeat, her
toying with the torch of vengeance, her jubilant welcome of a
rising dawn.</p>

<p>The curtain dropped, and the twenty-five hundred people
sat as though turned to stone. Innumerable glances sought the
box of the Grand Duke and found those slothful, unseeing
eyes of his. They saw the slightness and disproportionate
length of his body, the sinewy, bird-like neck above the round
collar of his uniform, the thin beard, the bumpy forehead, and
felt the atmosphere that rolled silently out from him and
dwelled in his track&mdash;the atmosphere of a million-atomed death.
And in the midst of these were those slothful eyes.</p>

<p>Then the applause broke out. Distinguished ladies contorted
their bodies, toothless old men yelled like boys, sophisticated
experts of the theatre climbed on their seats and waved.
When Eva appeared the noise died down. For ten seconds
nothing was heard but the sound of breathing and the rustle
of garments.</p>

<p>She looked into that gleaming sea of faces. The folds of her
white Greek garment were still as marble. Then the storm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
applause burst out anew. Over the balustrade of the gallery
a girl bent and stretched out her arms, and cried with a sob in
her voice, that rose above all the plaudits: “You have understood
us, little soul!”</p>

<p>Eva did not understand the Russian words. But it was not
necessary. She looked up, and their sense was clear to her.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>At midnight she appeared, as she had consented to do, in
the palace of Prince Fyodor Szilaghin.</p>

<p>So soon as she was seen, a respectful murmur and then a
silence surrounded her. Bearers of the most ancient names
were assembled, the most beautiful women of society and of the
court, and the representatives of foreign powers. Several
gentlemen had already formed a group about her, when Fyodor
Szilaghin approached, kissed her hand reverently, and drew her
skilfully from the group.</p>

<p>She passed through several rooms at his side. He did his
best to fascinate her and succeeded in holding her attention.</p>

<p>There was not a touch of banality about him. His gestures
and words were calculated to produce a desired effect with the
utmost coolness and subtlety. When he spoke he lowered his
eyes a little. The ease and fullness of speech that is characteristic
of all Russians had something iridescent in his case.
An arrogant and almost cynical consciousness of the fact that
he was handsome, witty, aloof, mysterious, and much desired
never left him. His eyebrows had been touched with kohl,
his lips with rouge. The dull blackness of his hair threw into
striking relief the transparent pallor of his beardless face.</p>

<p>“I find it most remarkable, Madame,” he said in a voice of
unfathomable falseness, “that your art has not to us Slavs the
oversophistication that is characteristic of most Western artists.
It is identical with nature. It would be instructive to know
the paths by which, from so different a direction, you reached
the very laws and forms on which our national dances as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
as our modern orchestral innovations are based. Undoubtedly
you are acquainted with both.”</p>

<p>“I am,” Eva answered, “and what I have seen is most uncommon.
It has power and character and enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>“Enthusiasm and perhaps something more&mdash;wild ecstasy,”
said the prince, with a significant smile. “Without that there
is no great creation in the world. Do you not believe that
Christ shared such ecstasy? As for me, I cannot be satisfied
with the commonly accepted figure of a gentle and gently
harmonious Christ.”</p>

<p>“It is a new point of view. It is worth thinking about,” Eva
said with kindly tolerance.</p>

<p>“However that may be,” Szilaghin went on, “among us all
things are still in the process of becoming&mdash;the dance as well
as religion. I do not hesitate to name these two in one breath.
They are related as a red rose is to a white. When I say that
we are still becoming, I mean that we have yet discovered no
limits either of good or evil. A Russian is capable of committing
the most cruel murder, and of shedding tears, within the
next hour, at the sound of a melancholy song. He is capable
of all wildness, excess, and horror, but also of magnanimity and
self-abnegation. No transformation is swifter or more terrible
than his, from hate to love, love to hate, happiness to despair,
faithfulness to treachery, fear to temerity. If you trust him
and yield yourself to him, you will find him pliant, high-souled,
and infinitely tender. Disappoint and maltreat him&mdash;he will
plunge into darkness and be lost in the darkness. He can
give, give, give, without end or reflection, to the point of
fanatical selflessness. Not until he is hurled to the uttermost
depths of hopelessness, does the beast in him awaken and
crash into destruction all that is about him.” The prince
suddenly stood still. “Is it indiscreet to ask, Madame, where
you will pass the month of May? I am told you intend to go
to the sea-shore.” He had said these words in a changed tone,
and regarded Eva expectantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>The question came to her like an attack from ambush.</p>

<p>Insensibly they had left the rooms destined for the guests
and passed into the extensive conservatories. Labyrinthine
paths, threading innumerable flowers and shrubs, led in all
directions. A dim light reigned, and where they stood in a
somewhat theatrical isolation, thousands of ghostly orchids
exhaled a breathless fragrance.</p>

<p>Skilfully and equivocally chosen as they were, the sense and
purport of Szilaghin’s words were very clear to Eva. Yet she
was tempted to oppose her own flexibility to his eel-like smoothness
of mind, despite the hidden threat of the situation. She
assumed a smile, as impenetrable as Szilaghin’s forehead and
large pupils, and answered: “Yes; I am going to Heyst. I
must rest. Life in this land of hidden madmen has wearied
me. It is too bad that I must be deprived, dear Prince, of
a mentor and sage like yourself.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Szilaghin dropped on one knee, and said softly:
“My master and friend beseeches you through me for the
favour of being near you wherever you may elect to go. He
insists on no exact time, but awaits your summons. I know
neither the degree nor the cause of your hesitation, dear
lady, but what pledge do you demand, what surety, for the
sincerity of a feeling that avoids no test and stops at no
sacrifice?”</p>

<p>“Please rise, prince,” Eva commanded him. She stepped
back a pace and stretched out her arms in a delicate gesture
of unwilling intimacy. “You are a spendthrift of yourself at
this moment. Please rise.”</p>

<p>“Not until you assure me that I shall be the bearer of
good news. Your decision is a grave one. Clouds are gathering
and awaiting a wind that may disperse them. Processions
are on the roads praying to avert an evil fate. I am but a
single, but a chance messenger. May I rise now?”</p>

<p>Eva folded her arms across her bosom, and retreated to the
very wall of hanging flowers. She became aware of the mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
and naked seriousness of fate. “Rise,” she said, with lowered
head, and twice did fire and pallor alternate on her cheeks.</p>

<p>Szilaghin arose and smiled, swiftly breathing. Again, in
silent reverence, he carried her hand to his lips. Then he led
her, subtly chatting as before, back among the other guests.</p>

<p>It was twelve hours after this that Christian received the
telegram which called him to Berlin.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Edgar Lorm played to crowded houses in Munich. His
popularity was such that he had to prolong his stay.</p>

<p>It pleased Crammon enormously and puffed him up. He
walked about as though he were the sole nurse of all this
glory.</p>

<p>One day he was at a tea given by a literary lady. In a corner
arose laughter that was obviously directed at him. He was
amused when he discovered that the whispering group gathered
there believed firmly that he was copying Lorm’s impersonation
of the Misanthrope.</p>

<p>Felix Imhof writhed in laughter when he heard the story.
“There’s something very attractive in the notion to people who
don’t really know you,” he said to Crammon. “It’s far more
likely that it’s the other way around, and that Lorm created his
impersonation by copying you.”</p>

<p>This interpretation was very flattering. Crammon smiled in
appreciation of it. Unconsciously he deepened the lines of misanthropy
in his chubby ecclesiastical face. When Lorm had
his picture taken as Alceste, Crammon took up his stand behind
the camera, and gazed steadily at the ripe statuesqueness of the
actor’s appearance.</p>

<p>It was his intention to learn. The rôle which had been
assigned him in the play of the actor’s life&mdash;the play that
lasted from nine o’clock every morning until eleven at night&mdash;began
to arouse his dissatisfaction. He desired it to be less
episodic. It seemed to him that Lorm, the director of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
particular play, should be persuaded to change the cast. He
told Lorm so quite frankly. For the actor was no longer
to him, as in the days of his youth, the crown and glory of
human existence and the vessel of noblest emotions, but a
means to an end. Nowadays one was forced to learn of
Lorm, to conceal one’s true feelings impenetrably, to gather
all one’s energy for the moment of one’s cue, to be thrifty
of one’s self, bravely to wear a credible mask, and thus to
assure each situation of a happy ending.</p>

<p>So Crammon said: “I’ve always had rather pleasant relations
with my partners. I can truly say that I’m an obliging
colleague and have always stolen away into the background
when it was their turn to have their monologues or great
scenes in the centre of the stage. But two of them, the
young lover and the heroine, have undoubtedly abused my
good nature. They’ve gradually shoved me out of the play
entirely. To their own hurt, too. The action promised to
be splendid. Since I’ve been shoved into the wings, it
threatens to be lost in the sand. It annoys me.”</p>

<p>Edgar Lorm smiled. “It seems to me rather that the
playwright is at fault than those two,” he answered. “And
no doubt it’s a mistake in construction. No experienced man
of the theatre would dispense with a character like yourself.”</p>

<p>“Prosit,” said Crammon, and lifted his glass. They were
sitting late in the Ratskeller.</p>

<p>“One must await developments,” Lorm continued. The
whole charade amused him immensely. “In the works of
good authors you sometimes find unexpected turns of the
action. You mustn’t scold till the final curtain.”</p>

<p>Crammon murmured morosely. “It’s taking a long time.
Some day soon I’m going to mount the stage and find out
in which act we are. I may make an extempore insertion.”</p>

<p>“For what particular line have you been engaged anyhow?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Lorm inquired. “Man of the world, character parts,
or heavy father?”</p>

<p>Crammon shrugged his shoulders. The two men looked
seriously at each other. A pleasant mood gleamed about
the actor’s narrow lips. “How long is it since we’ve seen
each other, old boy?” he said, and threw his arm affectionately
over Crammon’s shoulder. “It must be years. Until
recently I had a secretary who, whenever a letter came from
you, would lay it on my pillow at night. He meant that
action to express something like this: Look, Lorm, people
aren’t the filthy scamps you always call them. Well, he was
an idealist who had been brought up on chicory, potatoes, and
herring. You find that sort once in a while. As for you,
my dear Crammon, you’ve put on flesh. You’re comfortable
and compact in that nice tight skin of yours. I’m still
lean and feed on my own blood.”</p>

<p>“My fat is only a stage property,” said Crammon sadly.
“The inner me is untouched.”</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Whenever Lorm played, Judith Imhof was in the theatre.
But she went neither with her husband nor with Crammon.
They broke in upon her mood. She cared very little for
Crammon at any time. Unless he was very jocular, he seemed
to her insufferable.</p>

<p>She sat in the stalls, and in the entr’actes waved graciously
and calmly to Felix and Crammon in their box. She was
careless of the amazement of her acquaintances. If any one
had the temerity to ask why she sat alone, she answered,
“Imhof is annoyed when another is not pleased with something
that arouses his enthusiasm. So we go on different paths.”</p>

<p>Inevitably the curious person would ask next: “Then you
don’t care for Lorm?” Whereupon she would reply: “Not
greatly. He forces me to take a certain interest; but I resent
that. I think he’s terribly overrated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>One day a lady of her acquaintance asked her whether she
was happy in her marriage. “I don’t know,” she answered,
and laughed. “I haven’t any exact conception of what people
mean by happiness.” Her friend then asked her why
she had married. “Very simply,” she replied, “because being
a young girl got to be such an undelightful situation that
I sought to escape from it as soon as possible.” The lady
wanted to know whether she didn’t, then, love her husband.
“My dear woman,” Judith said, “love! There’s nothing so
mischievous as the loose way in which people use that word.
Most people, I believe, pretend quite shamelessly when they
talk about it, and defend it simply because they don’t want
to admit that they’ve been taken in. It’s exactly like the
king’s new clothes in the old fable. Every one acts mightily
important and enthusiastic, and won’t admit that the poor
king is naked to the winds.”</p>

<p>Another time she was asked whether she didn’t yearn to
have a child. “A child!” she cried out. “Horrors! Shall
I bring forth more food for the worms?”</p>

<p>Once, in company, the conversation turned to the question
of one’s sensitiveness to pain. Judith asserted that she
could bear any bodily torment without moving a muscle.
She was not believed. She procured a long, golden needle,
and bade one of the gentlemen pierce her whole arm with
it. When he refused in horror, she asked another of stronger
nerves who obeyed her. And really she did not twitch a
muscle. The blood gathered in a little pool. She smiled.</p>

<p>Felix Imhof could weep at the least excuse. When he
had a sick headache he wept. She despised this in him.</p>

<p>The actor took hold of her. She resisted in vain. The
spell he cast over her grew ever firmer, more indissoluble. She
brooded over it. Was it his transformations that attracted
her so?</p>

<p>Although he was forty, his body was as elegant and flexible
as polished steel. And like the ringing of steel was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
voice. The words were sparks. Under his tread the wooden
stage became a palæstra. Nothing clung or whined or crept.
Everything was tension, progression, verve, the rhythm of
storms. There was no inner weight or weariness. Bugles
soared. She agreed with Felix when he said: “There is
more of the true content of our age in this man than in all
the papers, editorials, pamphlets, and plethoric three-deckers
that the press has spewed forth within the past twenty years.
He has crowned the living word and made it our king.”</p>

<p>She was impatient to make the personal acquaintance of
Lorm. Crammon became the intermediary, and brought the
actor to her house. She was amazed at the homeliness of the
man’s face. She resented his insignificant, tilted nose and his
mediocre forehead. But the spell was not broken. She desired
to overlook these details and succeeded. They represented
but another transformation of that self which she believed
to be so infinitely varied.</p>

<p>He revealed himself as an epicure, with remnants of that
greed which marks the man who has risen from humble
things. The delights of the table induced in him outbursts of
noisy merriment. Over the oysters and the champagne he discussed
his worst enemies with benevolence.</p>

<p>He was so changeable of mood that it was exhausting to
associate with him. No one opposed him, and this lack of
opposition had produced an empty space about him that had
almost the guise of loneliness. He himself took it for the
solitariness of the soul, and cherished it with a proud pain.</p>

<p>He discoursed only in monologues. He listened only to himself.
But he did all that with the innocence of a savage. When
others spoke he disappeared in an inner absorption, his eyes
assumed a stony look. The part of him that remained conscious
was undeviatingly courteous, but this courtesy often
had an automatic air. When he came to speak again, he delighted
his hearers by his wit, his paradoxes, and his masterly
rendition of anecdotes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>He avoided conversation with women. Beauty and coquetry
made no impression on him. When women became enthusiastic
over him, his expression was one of merely courteous attention,
and his thoughts were contemptuous. He had no adventures,
and his name occurred in no racy stories. Once out of
the theatre, he lived the life of a private gentleman of simple
habits.</p>

<p>With cool but delicate perceptivity Judith examined the
conformation of his character. She who was utterly without
swift aspiration, whose dry nature perceived only the utilitarian,
only the expedient, who had been stifled in mere forms
from her girlhood, and esteemed nothing in others but the
external, garments, jewels, display, title, name&mdash;she was like
one possessed and charged with an electric fluid within three
days. She was fascinated primarily by external things: his
eye, his voice, his fame. But there was one deeper thing: the
illusion of his art.</p>

<p>She knew what she was doing. Her steps were scrupulously
calculated.</p>

<p>One day Lorm complained of the disorganization in his life,
the frightful waste of his substance. It was at table, and he
was answered by empty phrases. But Judith, when she succeeded
in having him to herself later, took up the subject
again. She persuaded him to describe the persons whom he
held responsible, and expressed doubts of their trustworthiness.
She disapproved of arrangements that he had made, gave him
advice that he found excellent, and reproached him with the
neglect of which he confessed himself guilty. “I wade in
money and suffocate in debt,” he sighed. “In twenty years
I’ll be an old man and a poor devil.”</p>

<p>Her practical insight filled him with naïve admiration. He
said to her: “I’ve been told once in a while that there are such
women in the world as you, but I never believed in their existence.
All I’ve ever seen were full of empty exactions and
florid emotions.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re unjust,” she replied and smiled. “Every woman
has some field in which she has character and firmness, but the
world pays no attention. Then, too, our relation to the world
is usually a false one.”</p>

<p>“That is a wise remark,” said Lorm in a satisfied voice.
He was a miser of praise.</p>

<p>From now on he loved to have her draw him into talk concerning
his little needs and worries. She examined him in
detail, and he was glad to submit. He brought her the bills
rendered him by his tradespeople. “They capitalize your
inexperience, and cheat you,” was Judith’s judgment of the
situation. It made him feel ashamed.</p>

<p>“Have you been lending money?” she asked. It appeared
that he had. For years and years he had loaned considerable
sums to numerous parasites. Judith shrugged her shoulders.
“You might just as well have thrown the money away.”</p>

<p>Lorm answered: “It’s such a bother when they come and
beg, and their faces are so unappetizing. I give them what
they ask just to be rid of them.”</p>

<p>In this wise their conversations moved wholly within the
circle of the prosaic things of daily life. But it was precisely
this that Edgar Lorm had missed and needed. It was as new
and as moving to him, as the discovery of a rapt and ecstatic
soul to a bourgeois becoming aware of poetry and passion.</p>

<p>Judith had a dream. She lay quite naked beside a slippery,
icy fish. And she lay with it from choice, and snuggled close
to its cold body. But suddenly she began to beat it, for its
cool, damp, slippery scales, which had a gleam of silver and
were opaline along its back, suddenly inspired in her a witch-like
fury. She beat and beat the creature, until she lost consciousness
and awoke exhausted.</p>

<p>An excursion into the valley of the Isar was arranged.
Crammon went, and Felix, a young friend of the latter, Lorm
and Judith. They took their coffee in the garden of an
inn, and on the way back, which led through woods, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
went in couples, Lorm and Judith being the last. “I’ve lost
my gold cigarette case,” Lorm announced suddenly, examining
his pocket, “I’ve got to go back the last part of the way.
I know I had it when we were in the village.” It was an object
precious in itself, and to which he attached a great value
because it had been given him by a king who had been devoted
to him in an enthusiastic friendship in his youth, and so it
was irreplaceable.</p>

<p>Judith nodded. “I’ll wait here,” she said, “I’m afraid I’m
too tired to cover the distance three times.”</p>

<p>He walked back and left Judith standing there, leaning her
head against a tree and reflecting. Her forehead wrinkled and
her eyes assumed a piercing look. It was silent in the wood;
no breeze stirred, no bird cried, no animal rustled in the
bushes. Time passed. Driven not at all by impatience, but by
her thoughts, which were both violent and decisive, she finally
left her place, and walked in the direction from which Lorm
would have to come. When she had been walking for a while,
she saw something golden gleaming in the moss. It was the
cigarette case, which she picked up calmly.</p>

<p>Lorm came back sorely vexed. He was silent, and as he
walked beside her, she quietly presented the case on her flat
hand. He made a gesture of joyous surprise, and she had to
tell him how she had found it.</p>

<p>For a while he seemed to be struggling with himself. Suddenly
he said: “How much easier life would be with you.”</p>

<p>Judith answered with a smile: “You talk of it as of something
unattainable.”</p>

<p>“I believe it to be so,” he murmured, with lowered head.</p>

<p>“If you’re thinking of my marriage,” Judith said, still smiling,
“I consider your expression exaggerated. The way out
would be simple.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t thinking of your marriage, but of your wealth.”</p>

<p>“Will you tell me your meaning more clearly.”</p>

<p>“At once.” He looked about him, and went up to a tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
“Do you see that little beetle? Look how busily he
works to climb the height before him. He has probably
worked his way up a considerable distance to-day. No doubt
he started before dawn. When he’s on top, he will have accomplished
something. But if I take him between my fingers
now and place him at the top, then the very path which his
own labour has dug becomes a thing of no value to him. That’s
the way it is with beetles and also with men.”</p>

<p>Judith considered. “Comparisons must halt. That’s their
prerogative, you know.” She spoke with gentle mockery. “I
don’t understand why one should reject another, simply because
that other doesn’t come with empty hands. It’s a funny
notion.”</p>

<p>“Between a hand that is empty, and one that commands
immeasurable treasures, there is a fatal difference,” Lorm said
with deep earnestness. “I have worked my way up from
poverty. You have no faintest notion of the meaning of that
word. All that I am and have, I owe to the immediate exertions
of my body and my brains. By your birth you have been
accustomed all your life to buy the bodies and the brains of
others. And though you had a thousand times more instinct
and vision for practical things and for the necessities of a
sane life than you have, yet you do not and could not comprehend
the profoundly moral and rightly revered relation of
accomplishment to reward. Your adventitious advantages have
constantly made it possible for you to ignore this relation, and
to substitute for it an arbitrary will. To me your wealth would
be paralysis, a mockery and a spectre.”</p>

<p>He looked at her with head thrown back.</p>

<p>“And so you think our case hopeless?” Judith asked, pale
and defiant.</p>

<p>“Since I cannot and dare not expect you to abandon your
millions and share the fate of a play-actor, it does indeed seem
hopeless.”</p>

<p>Judith’s face was quite colourless. “Let us go,” she said;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
“the others will remark our absence, and I dislike being gossiped
about.”</p>

<p>Swiftly and silently they walked on. They came to a clearing
and saw beneath a black rampart of clouds the throbbing,
crimson disc of the sun. Judith stared into it with raging fury.
For the first time her will had encountered a still stronger will.
It was rage that filled her eyes with tears, rage that wrung
from her discordant laughter. When Lorm looked at her in
pained surprise, she turned away and bit her lip.</p>

<p>“I’m capable of doing it,” she said to herself in her rage.
And the impulse hardened into a stubborn determination:
“I will! I will!”</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>When Christian arrived in Berlin with Amadeus Voss he
found, quite as he had expected, many people and a great
tumult about Eva. He could scarcely get to her. “I am tired,
Eidolon,” she cried out, when she caught sight of him. “Take
me away from everything.”</p>

<p>And again, when she had escaped the oppressive host of admirers,
she said: “How good it is that you are here, Eidolon.
I have waited for you with an ache in my heart. We’ll leave
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>But the journey was postponed from day to day. They
planned to live alone and in retirement at the Dutch watering
place that was their immediate goal, but Christian had
already met a dozen people who had ordered accommodations
there, and so he doubted the seriousness of Eva’s intentions.
People had become indispensable to her. When she was silent
she wanted, at least, to hear the voices of others; when she
was quiet she wanted movement about her.</p>

<p>When he stood before her the fragrance of her body penetrated
him like a great fear. His blood flowed in such violent
waves that his pulses lost the rhythm of their beating.</p>

<p>He had forgotten her face, the inimitable veracity of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
gestures, her power of feeling and inspiring ecstasy, her whole
powerful, delicate, flowerlike, radiant being. Everything
seemed to yield to her, even the elements. When she appeared
in the street, the sun shone more purely and the air was more
temperate; and thus the wild turmoil about her was transformed
into a steady and obedient tide.</p>

<p>Susan said to Christian: “We are to dance here, and have
offers. But we don’t like the Prussians. They seem an arid
folk, who save their money for soldiers and barracks. I haven’t
seen a real face. All men and all women look alike. They may
be worthy, no doubt they are; but they seem machine-made.”</p>

<p>“Eva herself is a German,” Christian rebuked the woman’s
spiteful words.</p>

<p>“Bah, if a genius is cast forth from heaven and tumbles on
the earth, it is blind and cannot choose its place. Where is
Herr von Crammon?” she interrupted herself. “Why doesn’t
he come to see us? And whom have you brought in his
stead?” She poked out her chin toward Amadeus Voss, who
stood timidly in a corner, and whose large spectacles made him
look like an owl. “Who is that?”</p>

<p>Who is that? The same question appeared in the astonished
faces of Wiguniewski and of the Marquis of Tavera. Amadeus
was new to the world with a vengeance. The fixed expression
on his features had something so silly at times, that Christian
was ashamed of him and the others laughed.</p>

<p>Voss wandered about the streets, pushed himself into crowds,
surveyed the exhibits behind the plate-glass windows of shops,
stared into coffee-houses, bought newspapers and pamphlets,
but found no way of calming his soul. All he could see was
the face of the dancer, and the gestures with which she cut a
fruit or greeted a friend or bowed or sat down in a chair or
arose or smelled a flower, or the motions of her lids and lips
and neck and shoulders and hips and legs. And he found all
these things in her provocative and affected, and yet they had
bitten into his brain as acid bites into metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>One evening he entered Christian’s room, and his face was
the colour of dust.</p>

<p>“Who really is Eva Sorel?” he asked, with a bitter rancour.
“Where does she come from? To whom does she belong?
What are we doing here with her? Tell me something about
her. Enlighten me.” He threw himself into a chair, and
stared at Christian.</p>

<p>When Christian, unprepared for this tempest of questions,
made no answer, he went on: “You’ve put me into a new skin,
but the old Adam writhes in it still. Is this a masquerade?
If so, tell me at least what the masks represent. I seem to
be disguised too, but badly. I expect you to improve my
disguise.”</p>

<p>“You aren’t disguised any worse than the others,” Christian
said, with a soothing smile.</p>

<p>Voss rested his head on his two hands. “So she’s a dancer,
a dancer,” he murmured thoughtfully. “To my way of feeling
there has always been something lewd about that word and
what it means. How can it help arousing images that bring
the blush to one’s cheek?” Suddenly he looked up, and asked
with a piercing glance: “Is she your mistress?”</p>

<p>The blood left Christian’s face. “I think I understand what
disturbs you so,” he said. “But now that you’ve gone with
me, you must bear with me. I don’t know how long we shall
stay with this crowd, and I can’t myself tell exactly why we
are here. But you must not ask me about Eva Sorel. We
must not discuss her either for praise or blame.”</p>

<p>Voss was silenced.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Christian, Amadeus, Bradshaw, Tavera, and Wiguniewski
went by motor. Eva used the train.</p>

<p>But this way of travelling agreed with her as ill as any
other. All night she lay sleepless in her crumpled silks, her
head buried among pillows. Susan crouched by her, giving her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
perfume or a book or a glass of cold lemonade. There was a
prickling in her limbs that would not let her rest, a weight on
her bosom, an alternation of thought and fancy, of willing and
the weariness of willing in her mind. The hum of the wheels
on the rails cut into her nerves; the sable landscape, as it
glided by, irritated her like a delusion that forever changed and
melted. Malignity seemed to lurk in the fields; treacherous
forests seemed to block the way; she saw haunted houses and
terror-stricken men.</p>

<p>“What a torturer time is!” she whispered. “Oh, that it
stood before me, and I could have it whipped.”</p>

<p>Susan bent nearer, and gazed at her attentively.</p>

<p>Suddenly she whispered tenderly: “What do you expect of
him? What is the purpose of this new game? He’s the most
banal of them all. I never heard him make a polished or a
witty remark. Does he realize what you are? Not in his
wildest dreams. His head is empty. Your art means about
as much to him as the acrobatics of a circus dancer to some
dreary shop-keeper. Nations are at your feet, and he grants
you a supercilious smile. You have given the world a new
kind of delight, and this German know-it-all is untouched and
unchanged by it.”</p>

<p>Eva said: “If the North Sea is too sinister, we must seek
a coast in the South.”</p>

<p>Susan grew excited: “One would like to yell into his ears:
‘Get on your knees! Pray!’ But he wouldn’t be shaken any
more than the pillar of Vendôme. Is he ever shaken by anything?
I described to him how we were adored in Russia,
the ecstasy, the festivities, the outbursts of enthusiasm. He
acted as if he were hearing a moderately interesting bit of
daily news. I told him about the Grand Duke. No, don’t
frown. I had to, or I would have choked. I described that
chained barbarian, that iron soul dissolved! It’s certainly
uncommon; it would make any heart beat faster. I tried to
make him visualize the situation: fifty millions of trembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
slaves and all, through his power, at your bidding. No poet
could have been more impressive than I was. If you had
heard me trying to penetrate his mind, you would have been
astonished at my talent for sewing golden threads on sack
cloth. It was all in vain. His breath came as regularly as the
ticking of a clock. Once or twice he seemed to be startled.
But it was due to a breeze or a mosquito.”</p>

<p>“I wonder whether the gowns from Paris have arrived at
Heyst,” Eva said. The long oval of her face seemed to grow
a trifle longer; her lips curled a little, and her teeth showed like
pallid, freshly peeled almonds.</p>

<p>“Why did you refuse yourself to him?” Susan went on.
“What we possess is part of our past, but a joy put off is a
burden. Men are to be the rungs of your ladder&mdash;no more.
Let them give you magical nights, but send them packing when
the cock crows. How has he deserved a higher office? You’ve
yielded to a whim, and made a grinning idol of him. Why
did you summon him? I’m afraid you’re going to commit a
folly.”</p>

<p>Eva did not answer. The tip of her tongue appeared between
her lips, and she closed her eyes cunningly. Susan
thought she understood those gestures, and said: “It’s true, he
has the marvellous diamond for which you cried. But you have
but to command, and they’ll trim your very shoes with such
baubles.”</p>

<p>“When did you ever see me cry for a diamond?” Eva, asked
indifferently. She raised herself up, and in her transparent,
wavering, blossomy wrappings seemed like a spirit emerging
from the dimness. “When did you ever see me cry for a
diamond?” she asked again, and touched Susan’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You told me so yourself.”</p>

<p>“Have you no better proof?” Eva laughed, and her laughter
was her most sensuous form of expression, as her smile was
her most spiritual.</p>

<p>Susan folded her hands and said resignedly: “<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Volvedme del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
otro lado, que de esto ya estoy tostado!</span>” It is a Spanish
ejaculation, and means: Lay me on the other side, for I have
been toasted enough on this.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>The house that Eva had taken was not very far from the
beach. It was an old manor, which William of Orange had
built, and which had belonged to the late Duchess of Leuchtenberg
until a few years ago.</p>

<p>The rooms, built of mighty blocks of stone, soothed Eva.
By day and night she heard the long-drawn thunder of the
waves. Whenever she picked up a book, she dropped it again
soon and listened.</p>

<p>She walked through those rooms, full of ancient furniture
and dark portraits, glad to possess herself, and to await without
torment him who came to her. She greeted him with half-closed
eyes, and with the smile of one who has yielded herself
wholly.</p>

<p>Susan practised on a piano with muted strings. When she
had finished her task, she slunk away and remained hidden.</p>

<p>Christian and Amadeus Voss had taken lodgings in a neighbouring
villa&mdash;Voss on the ground floor, Christian above. Since
Christian neither asked questions nor detained him, Voss went
out in the morning and returned in the evening or even late
at night. He did not say where he had been, or what he had
seen or experienced.</p>

<p>At breakfast on the third morning, he said to Christian:
“It’s a thankless task to unchain a fellow like me. I breathe
a different breath and sleep a different sleep. Somewhere my
soul is ranging about, and I’m chasing it. I’ve got to catch it
first, before I know how things are with me.”</p>

<p>Christian did not look up. “We’re invited to dine with Eva
Sorel to-night,” he said.</p>

<p>Voss bowed ironically. “That invitation looks damnably
like charity,” he said harshly. “I feel the resistance of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
people to me, and their strangeness, in my very bones. What
a superfluous comedy! What shall I do there? Nearly all of
them talk French. I’m a provincial, a villager, and ridiculous.
And that’s worse than being a murderer or thief. I may make
up my mind to commit arson or murder, so as not to be ridiculous
any more.” He opened his mouth as though to laugh, but
uttered no sound.</p>

<p>“I’m surprised, Amadeus, that your thoughts always cling
to that one point,” Christian said. “Do you really believe
it to be of such decisive importance? No one cares whether
you’re poor or rich. Since you appear in my company, no one
questions your equality, or would be so vulgar as to question
it. The feelings that you express originate in yourself, and
you seem to take a kind of perverse joy in them. You like to
torment yourself, and then revenge yourself on others. I
hope you won’t take my frankness amiss.”</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss grinned. “Sometimes, Christian Wahnschaffe,
I’d like to pat your head, as though I were your teacher, and
say: You did that very well. Yes, it was wonderfully well
done. And yet your little arrow went astray. To hit me,
you must take better aim. It is true that the morbidness is
deep in my soul, far too deep to be eradicated by a few inexpensive
aphorisms. When this Russian prince or this Spanish
legate shake hands with me, I feel as though I had forged
cheques and would be discovered in a minute. When this lady
passes by me, with her indescribable fragrance and the rustling
of her garments, I grow dizzy, as though I dangled high over
an abyss, and my whole soul writhes in its own humiliation and
slavishness. It writhes and writhes, and I can’t help it. I was
born that way. This is not my world, and cannot become mine.
The under dogs must bleed to death, for the upper dogs consider
that the order of the world. I belong to that lower
kind. My place is with those who have the odour of decayed
flesh, whom all avoid, who go about with an eternally festering
wound. The law of my being ranges me with them. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
no power to change that, nor has any pleasant agreement. This
is not my world, Wahnschaffe; and if you don’t want me to
lose my reason and do some mischief, you had better take me
out of it so soon as possible, or else send me away.”</p>

<p>Christian passed the tips of his fingers over his forehead.
“Have patience, Amadeus. I believe it is not my world any
longer. Give me but a little more time in which to straighten
out my own thoughts.”</p>

<p>Voss’s eyes clung to Christian’s hands and lips. The words
had been quietly, almost coolly uttered, yet there was a deep
conflict in them and an expression that had power over Voss.
“I cannot imagine a man leaving this woman, if once he has
her favour,” he said, with a hovering malice on his lips, “unless
she withdraws her favour.”</p>

<p>Christian could not restrain a gesture of aversion. “We’ll
meet to-night then,” he said, and arose.</p>

<p>An hour later Amadeus Voss saw him and Eva on the beach.
He was coming down the dunes, and saw them on the flat
sands by the foam of the waves. He stopped, shaded his eyes
with his hands, and gazed out over the ocean as though watching
for a sail. The other two did not see him. They walked
along in a rhythmic unity, as of bodies that have tested the
harmony of their vibrations. After a while they, too, stopped
and stood close together, and were defined like two dark,
slender shafts against the iron grey of air and water.</p>

<p>Voss threw himself into the sparse, stiff grass, and buried his
forehead in the moist sand. Thus he lay many hours.</p>

<p>Evening came. Its great event was to be the appearance
of Eva with the diamond Ignifer in her hair. She wore it in an
exquisitely wrought setting of platinum, and it shone above her
head, radiant and solitary, like a ghostly flame.</p>

<p>She felt its presence in every throb of her heart. It was a
part of her, at once her justification and her crown. It was no
longer an adornment but a blazing and convincing symbol of
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>For a while there was an almost awestruck silence. The
lovely Beatrix Vanleer, a Belgian sculptress, cried out in her
astonishment and admiration.</p>

<p>The smile of gentle intoxication faded from Eva’s face, and
her eyes turned far in their sockets, and she saw Amadeus
Voss, whose face was of a bluish pallor.</p>

<p>His mouth was half open like an imbecile’s, his head thrust
brutally forward, his hanging arms twitched. He approached
slowly, with eyes staring at the ineffable glow of the jewel.
Those who stood on either side of him were frightened and
made way. Eva turned her face aside, and stepped back two
paces. Susan emerged beside her, and laid protective arms
about her. At the same moment Christian went up to Voss,
grasped his hand, and drew the quite obedient man aside.</p>

<p>Christian’s attitude and expression had something that
calmed every one. As though nothing had happened, a vivid
and twittering conversation arose.</p>

<p>Voss and Christian stood on the balcony of stone. Voss
drank the salt sea air deep into his lungs. He asked hoarsely:
“Was that Ignifer?”</p>

<p>Christian nodded. He listened to the sea. The waves thundered
like falling fragments of rock.</p>

<p>“I have grasped the whole secret of your race,” Amadeus
murmured, and the convulsion in his face melted under the
influence of Christian’s presence. “I have understood both
man and woman. In this diamond are frozen your tears and
your shudderings, your voluptuousness and your darkness too.
It is a bribe and an accursed delusion, a terrible fetish! How
keenly aware am I now of your days and nights, Wahnschaffe,
of all that is between you and her, since I have seen the gleam
of this mineral which the Lord created out of the slime, even
as He created me and you and her. That stone is without
pain&mdash;earthly, and utterly without pain, burned pure and
merciless. My God, my God, and think of me, of me!”</p>

<p>Christian did not understand this outburst, but it shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
him to the soul. Its power swept aside the vexation which
Voss’s shameless eloquence had aroused. He listened to
the sea.</p>

<p>Voss pulled himself together. He went up to the balustrade,
and said with unnatural self-control, “You counselled patience
to-day. What was your purpose? It sounded as equivocal
and as general as all you say to me. It is convenient to talk
of patience. It is a luxury like any other luxury at your command,
only less costly. There is no word, however, worthier
of hatred or contempt. It is always false. Closely looked upon,
it means cowardice and sloth. What have you in mind?”</p>

<p>Christian did not answer. Or, rather, he assumed having
answered; and after a long while, and out of deep meditation,
he asked: “Do you believe that it is of any use?”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand,” said Voss, and looked at him helplessly.
“Use? To what end or how?”</p>

<p>Christian, however, did not enlighten him further.</p>

<p>Voss wanted to go home, but Christian begged him to stay,
and so they went in and joined the others at dinner.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>When the dinner was over, the company returned to the
drawing-room. The conversation began in French, but in
deference to Mr. Bradshaw, who did not understand that
language, changed to German.</p>

<p>The American directed the conversation toward the dying
races of the New World, and the tragedy of their disappearance.
Eva encouraged him, and he told of an experience he had had
among the Navaho Indians.</p>

<p>The Navaho tribe had offered the longest resistance to
Christianity and to its civilization. To subdue them the
United States Government forbade the practice of the immemorial
Yabe Chi dance, the most solemn ritual of their cult.
The commissioner who was to convey this order, and on whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
staff Mr. Bradshaw had been, yielded to the passionate entreaty
of the tribal chief, and gave permission for a final celebration
of the dance. At midnight, by the light of campfires
and of pine torches, the brilliantly feathered and tattooed
dancers and singers appeared. The singers sang songs which
told of the fates of three heroes, who had been captured by a
hostile tribe and freed by the god Ya. He taught them to ride
the lightning; they fled into the cave of the Grizzly Bear, and
thence into the realm of butterflies. The dances gave a plastic
representation of these adventures. While the craggy mountains
re-echoed the songs, and the contorted dances in the
tawny glow rose to an ecstasy of despair, a terrific storm broke.
Cascades of water poured from the sky and filled the dried
river-beds with roaring torrents; the fires were extinguished;
the medicine men prayed with uplifted arms; the dancers and
singers, certain now that they had incurred the anger of their
god, whose sacred ceremony they had consented to betray,
hurled themselves in their wild pain into the turbulent waters,
which carried their bodies far down into the plain.</p>

<p>When Mr. Bradshaw had ended, Eva said: “The gods are
vengeful; even the gentlest will defend their seats.”</p>

<p>“That is a heathen view,” said Amadeus, in a sharp and
challenging voice. “There are no gods. There are idols, to be
sure, and these must be broken.” He looked defiantly about
him, and added in a dragging tone: “For the Lord saith, no
man can look upon me and live.”</p>

<p>Smiles met his outburst. Tavera had not understood, and
turned to Wiguniewski, who whispered an explanation in
French. Then the Spaniard smiled too, compassionately and
maliciously.</p>

<p>Voss arose with a tormented look on his face. The merriment
in those faces was like a bodily chastisement to him.
From behind his glittering eye-glasses he directed a venomous
glance toward Eva, and said in troubled tones: “In the same
context of Scripture the Lord bids Israel hurl aside its adorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>ments
that He may see what He will do with them. The meaning
is clear.”</p>

<p>“He cannot expiate the lust of the eye,” Christian thought,
and avoided Eva’s glance.</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss left the company and the house. On the
street he ran as though pursued, clasping his hands to his
temples. He had pushed his derby hat far back. When he
reached his room, he opened his box and drew out a package
of letters. They were the stolen letters of the unknown woman
F. He sat down by his lamp, and read with tense absorption
and a burning forehead. It was not the first night that he
had passed thus.</p>

<p>When Eva was alone with Christian, she asked: “Why did
you bring that man with you?”</p>

<p>He laughed, and lifted her up in his arms, and carried her
through many flights of rooms and out of light into darkness.</p>

<p>“The sea cries!” her lips said at his ear.</p>

<p>He prayed that all sounds might die out of the world except
the thunder of the sea and that young voice at his ear. He
prayed that those two might silence the disquiet that overcame
him in her very embraces and made him, at the end of every
ecstasy, yearn for its renewal.</p>

<p>That slender, passionate body throbbed toward him. Yet
he heard the lamentation of an alien voice: What shall we do?</p>

<p>“Why did you bring this man?” Eva asked him far in the
night, between sleep and sleep. “I cannot bear him. There is
always sweat on his forehead. He comes from a sinister
world.”</p>

<p>There was a bluish twilight in the room that came from the
blue flame of a blue lamp, and a bluish darkness lay beyond the
windows.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you answer me?” she urged, and raised herself,
showing the pale face amid its wilderness of brown hair.</p>

<p>He had no answer for her. He feared the insufficiency of
any explanation, as well as the replies that she would find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is the meaning of it all? What ails you, dearest?”
Eva drew him toward her, and clung to him, and kissed his
eyes thirstily.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask him to avoid your presence,” said Christian. And
suddenly he saw himself and Voss in the farm yard of Nettersheim,
saw the kneeling men and maid servants, the old rusty
lantern, the dead woman, and the carpenter who was measuring
her for her coffin.</p>

<p>“Tell me what he means to you,” whispered Eva. “It seems
to me suddenly as though you were gone. Where are you
really? Tell me, dear friend.”</p>

<p>“You should have let me love you in those old days in
Paris,” said Christian gently, and softly rested his cheek
against her bosom, “in those days when Crammon and I came
to you.”</p>

<p>“Speak, only speak,” Eva breathed, seeking to hide the
fright in her heart.</p>

<p>Her eyes gleamed, and her skin was like luminous white
satin. In the darkness her face had a spiritualized thinness;
the restrained charm of her gestures mastered the hour, and
her smile was deep and intricate of meaning, and everything
about her was play and mirroring and raptness and unexpected
magic. Christian looked upon her.</p>

<p>“Do you remember words that you once spoke to me?” he
asked. “You said: ‘Love is an art like poetry or music, and
he who does not understand that, finds no grace in love’s
sight.’ Were not those your words?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were. Speak to me, my darling!”</p>

<p>He held her in his arms, and the life of her body, its warmth,
its blood that was conscious of him, and its vibration that was
toward him, made speech a little easier. “You see,” he said
thoughtfully, and caressed her hand, “I have only enjoyed
women. Nothing more. I have been ignorant of that love
which is an art. It was so easy. They adored me, and I took
no pains. They put no hindrances on my path, and so my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
foot passed over them. Not one demanded a fulfilment of me.
They were happy enough if I was but contented. But you,
Eva, you’re not satisfied with me. You look at me searchingly
and watch me; and your vigil continues even at those moments
when one floats beyond thought and knowledge. And it is because
you are not satisfied with me. Or is that an error, a
deception?”</p>

<p>“It is so very late,” said Eva, and, leaning her head back
upon the pillows, she closed her eyes. She listened to the
perished echo of her own voice, and the oppression of her
heart almost robbed her of breath.</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>It was in another night. They had been jesting and telling
each other amusing stories, and at last they had grown
weary.</p>

<p>Suddenly in the darkness outside of the window Christian
had a vision of his father and of the dog Freia; and his father
had the tread of a lonely man. Never had Christian seen loneliness
so visibly embodied. The dog was his only companion.
He had sought for another friend, but there had been none to
go with him.</p>

<p>“How is that possible?” Christian thought.</p>

<p>His senses were lost in a strange drowsiness, even while he
held Eva’s beautiful body, which was as smooth and cool as
ivory. And in this drowsiness visions emerged of his brother,
his sister, his mother, and about each of them was that great
loneliness and desolation.</p>

<p>“How is that possible?” Christian thought. “Their lives
are thronged with people.”</p>

<p>But he answered himself, and said: “Is not your own life
likewise thronged with people to suffocation, and do you not
also feel that same loneliness and desolateness?”</p>

<p>Now a dark object seemed to descend upon him. It was a
coat&mdash;a wet, dripping coat. And at the same moment some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
one called out to him: “Arise, Christian, arise!” But he could
not arise, for those ivory arms held him fast.</p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of Letitia. She uttered but one
word: “Why?” It seemed to him, while he slept, if indeed he
slept, that he should have chosen Letitia, who lived but for her
dreams, her yearnings and imaginings, and who had been
sacrificed with her dreams to the vulgar world of reality. It
seemed to him as though Letitia, pointing to Eva, were saying:
“What do you seek of her? She knows nothing of you, but
weaves at the web of her own life. She is ambitious, and can
give you no help in your suffering; and it is only to forget and
deaden the pain of your soul that you are wasting yourself
upon her.”</p>

<p>Christian was astonished to find Letitia so wise. He was
almost inclined to smile at her wisdom. But he knew now
clearly that he was suffering. It was a suffering of an unfathomable
nature, which grew from hour to hour and from
day to day, like the spreading of a gangrened wound.</p>

<p>His head rested on the shoulder of his beloved; her little
breasts rose from the violet shadows and had trembling contours.
He felt her beauty with every nerve, and her strangeness
and exquisite lightness. He felt that he loved her with
all his thoughts and with every fibre of his flesh, and that,
despite it all, he could find no help in her.</p>

<p>And again a voice cried: “Arise, Christian, arise!” But he
could not arise. For he loved this woman, and feared life
without her.</p>

<p>The dawn was breaking when Eva turned her face to him
again: “Where are you?” she asked. “What are you gazing
at?”</p>

<p>He answered: “I am with you.”</p>

<p>“To the last stirrings of your thought?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Who knows the last recesses of his mind?”</p>

<p>“I want you wholly. With every breath. And something of
you escapes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you,” Christian asked evasively, “are you utterly with
me?”</p>

<p>She answered passionately, and with an imperious smile, as
she drew closer to him: “You are more mine than I am yours.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Does it frighten you? Are you miserly in your love?
Yes, you are more mine. I have broken the spell that held you
and melted your soul of stone.”</p>

<p>“Melted my soul...?” Christian asked in amazement.</p>

<p>“I have, my darling. Don’t you know that I’m a sorceress?
I have power over the fish in the sea, the horse on the sod, the
vulture in the air, and the invisible deities that are spoken of
in the books of the Persians. I can make of you what I would,
and you must yield.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” Christian admitted.</p>

<p>“But your soul does not look at me,” Eva cried, and flung
her arms about him, “it is an alien soul, dark, hostile, unknown.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re misusing the power you have over me,
and my soul resists.”</p>

<p>“It is to obey&mdash;that is all.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is not wholly sure of you.”</p>

<p>“I can give your soul only the assurance of the hour that
is.”</p>

<p>“What are you planning?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me! Hold me fast with your thoughts. Don’t
let me go for a moment, or we are lost to each other. Cling
to me with all your might.”</p>

<p>Christian answered: “It seems to me as though I ought to
know what you mean. But I don’t want to know it. Because
you see, you ... I ... all this ... it’s too insignificant.”
He shook his head in a troubled way. “Too insignificant.”</p>

<p>“What, what do you mean by that?” Eva cried in fright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and clung to his right hand with both hers. Tensely she
looked into his face.</p>

<p>“Too insignificant,” Christian repeated stubbornly, as
though he could find no other words.</p>

<p>Then he reflected on all he had said and heard with his
accustomed scepticism and toughmindedness, and arose and
bade his friend good-night.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Edgar Lorm was playing in Karlsruhe. On a certain evening
he had increased the tempo of his playing, and given vent to
his disgust with his rôle, the piece, his colleagues, and his
audience so obviously that there had been hissing after the
last act.</p>

<p>“I’m a poor imbecile,” he said to his colleagues at their
supper in a restaurant. “Every play actor is a poor imbecile.”
He looked at them all contemptuously, and smacked his
lips.</p>

<p>“We must have had more inner harmony in the days when
we were suspected of stealing shirts from the housewife’s line
and children were frightened at our name. Don’t you think so?
Or maybe you’re quite comfortable in your stables.”</p>

<p>His companions observed a respectful silence. Wasn’t he
the famous man who filled the houses, and whom both managers
and critics flattered?</p>

<p>Dust was whirling in the streets, the dust of summer, as he
returned to his hotel. How desolate I feel, he thought, and
shook himself. Yet his step was free and firm as a young
huntsman’s.</p>

<p>When he had received his key and turned toward the lift,
Judith Imhof suddenly stood before him. He started, and then
drew back.</p>

<p>“I am ready to be poor,” she said, almost without moving
her lips.</p>

<p>“Are you here on business, dear lady?” Lorm asked in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
clear, cold voice. “Undoubtedly you are expecting your husband&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“I am expecting no one but you, and I am alone,” answered
Judith, and her eyes blazed.</p>

<p>He considered the situation with a wrinkled face that made
him look old and homely. Then with a gesture he invited her
to follow him, and they entered the empty reading room. A
single electric lamp burned above the table covered with newspapers.
They sat down in two leather armchairs. Judith toyed
nervously with her gold mesh-bag. She wore a travelling frock,
and her face was tired.</p>

<p>Lorm began the conversation. “First of all: Is there any
folly in your mind that can still be prevented?”</p>

<p>“None,” Judith answered in a frosty tone. “If the condition
you made was only a trick to scare me off, and you are
cowardly enough to repudiate it at the moment of its fulfilment,
then, of course, I have been self-deceived, and my business
here is at an end. Don’t soothe me with well-meant
speeches. The matter was too serious to me for that.”</p>

<p>“That is sharply and bitterly said, Judith, but terribly impetuous,”
Lorm said, with quiet irony. “I’m an old hand at
living, and far from young, and a good bit too experienced to
fly into the passion of a Romeo at even the most precious
offers and surprises of a woman. Suppose we discuss what
you’ve done like two friends, and you postpone for a bit any
final judgment of my behaviour.”</p>

<p>Judith told him that she had written her father, and requested
him to make some other disposition of the annual
income which he had settled on her at the time of her marriage,
since she had determined to get a divorce from Felix Imhof,
and to marry a man who had made this step a definite condition
of their union. At the same time she had made a legal
declaration of her renunciation before a notary, which she
had brought to show Lorm, and intended thereupon to send on
to her father. All this she told him very calmly. Felix had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
known nothing of her intentions at the time of her departure.
She had left a note for him in the care of his valet. “Explanations
are vain under such circumstances,” she said. “To tell
a man whom one is leaving why one is leaving him is as
foolish as turning back the hands of the clock in the hope of
really bringing back hours that are dead. He knows where
I am and what I want. That’s enough. Anyhow, it’s not the
sort of thing he comprehends, and there are so many affairs
in his busy life that one more or less will make little difference.”</p>

<p>Lorm sat quietly, his head bent forward, his chin resting on
the mother-of-pearl handle of his stick. His carefully combed
hair, which was brown and still rather thick, gleamed in the
light. His brows were knit. In the lines about his nose, and
his wearied actor’s mouth, there was a deep joylessness.</p>

<p>A waiter appeared at the door and vanished again.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you’re letting yourself in for,
Judith,” Lorm said, and tapped the floor lightly with his feet.</p>

<p>“Then tell me about it, so that I can adjust myself.”</p>

<p>“I’m an actor,” he said almost threateningly.</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>He laid his stick on the table, and folded his hands. “I’m an
actor,” he repeated, and his face assumed the appearance of a
mask. “My profession involves my representing human nature
at its moments of extreme expressiveness. The fascination
of the process consists in the artificial concentration of
passion, its immediate projection, and the assigning to it of
consequences that reality rarely or never affords. And so it
naturally happens&mdash;and this deception is the fatal law of the
actor’s life&mdash;that my person, this Edgar Lorm who faces you
here, is surrounded by a frame that suits him about as well as
a Gothic cathedral window would suit a miniature. A further
consequence is that I lack all power of adjustment to any
ordered social life, and all my attempts to bring myself in
harmony with such a life have been pitiable failures. I strug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>gle
and dance in a social vacuum. My art is beaten
foam.</p>

<p>“I’ve been told of people who have a divided personality.
Well, mine is doubled, quadrupled. The real me is extinct. I
detest the whole business; I practise my profession because I
haven’t any other. I’d like to be a librarian in the service of a
king or a rich man who didn’t bother me, or own a farm in
some Swiss valley. I’m not talking about the accidental
miseries of the theatre, disgusting and repulsive as they are&mdash;the
masquerading, the lies and vanities. And I don’t want you
to believe either that I’m uttering the average lament of the
spoiled mime, which is made up of inordinate self-esteem and
of coquettish fishing for flattering contradiction.</p>

<p>“My suffering lies a little deeper. Its cause is, if you will try
to understand me, the spoken word. It has caused a process
within me that has poisoned my being and destroyed my soul.
What word, you may ask? The words that pass between man
and man, husband and wife, friend and friend, myself and
others. Language, which you utter quite naturally, has in my
case passed through all the gamuts of expression and all the
temperatures of the mind. You use it as a peasant uses his
scythe, the tailor his needle, the soldier his weapon. To me it
is a property and a ghost, a mollusk and an echo, a thing of a
thousand transformations, but lacking outline and kernel. I
cry out words, whisper them, stammer them, moan, flute, distend
them, and fill the meaningless with meaning, and am depressed
to the earth by the sublime. And I’ve been doing that
for five and twenty years. It has worn me thin; it has split
my gums and hollowed out my chest.</p>

<p>“Hence all words, sincere as they may be on others’
lips, are untrue on mine, untrue to me. They tyrannise
over me and torment me, flicker through the walls, recall
to me my powerlessness and unrewarded sacrifices, and
change me into a helpless puppet. Can I ever, without
being ashamed to the very marrow, say: I love? How many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
meanings have not those words! How many have I been
forced to give them! If I utter them I practise merely the
old trick of my trade, and make the pasteboard device upon my
head look like a golden crown. Consider me closely and you
will see the meaning of literal despair. Words have been my
undoing. It sounds queer, I know; but it is true. It may be
that the actor is the absolute example of hopeless despair.”</p>

<p>Judith looked at him rather emptily. “I don’t suppose
that we’ll torture each other much with words,” she said, merely
to say something.</p>

<p>But Edgar Lorm gave to this saying a subtle interpretation,
and nodded gratefully. “What an infinitely desirable condition
that would be,” he answered, in his stateliest manner; “because,
you see, words and emotions are like brothers and
sisters. The thing that I detest saying is mouldy and flat to me
in the realm of feeling too. One should be silent as fate. It
may be that I am spoiled for any real experience&mdash;drained dry.
I have damned little confidence in myself, and nothing but
pity for any hand stretched out to save me. However that
may be,” he ended, and arose with elastic swiftness, “I am
willing to try.”</p>

<p>He held out his hand as to a comrade. Charmed by the
vividness and knightly grace of his gesture, Judith took his
hand and smiled.</p>

<p>“Where are you stopping?” he asked.</p>

<p>“In this hotel.”</p>

<p>Chatting quite naturally he accompanied her to the door
of her room.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>On the next afternoon Felix Imhof suddenly appeared at
the hotel. He sent up his card to Judith, and waited in the
hall. He walked up and down, swinging his little cane, carelessly
whistling through his thick lips, his brain burdened with
affairs, speculations, stock quotations, a hundred obligations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and appointments. But whenever he passed the tall windows,
he threw a curious and merry glance out into the street, where
two boys were having a fight.</p>

<p>But now and then his face grew dark, and a quiver passed
over it.</p>

<p>The page returned, and bade him come up.</p>

<p>Judith was surprised to see him. He began to talk eagerly
at once. “I have business in Liverpool, and wanted to see you
once more before leaving. A crowd of people came, who all
had some business with you. Invitations came for you, and
telephone calls; your dressmaker turned up, and letters, and
I was, of course, quite helpless. I can’t very well receive people
with the agreeable information that my wife has just taken
French leave of me. There are a thousand things; you have
to disentangle them, or the confusion will be endless.”</p>

<p>They talked for a while of the indifferent things which,
according to him, had brought him here. Then he added:
“I had an audience with the Prince Regent this forenoon.
He bestowed a knighthood on me yesterday.”</p>

<p>Judith’s face flushed, and she had the expression of one
who, in a state of hypnosis, recalls his waking consciousness.</p>

<p>Felix tapped against his faultlessly creased trousers with
his stick. “I beg your pardon for venturing any criticism,”
he said, “but I can’t help observing that the whole matter
might have been better managed. To run off with that degree
of suddenness&mdash;well, it wasn’t quite the proper thing, a little
beneath us, not quite fair.”</p>

<p>Judith shrugged her shoulders. “Things that are inevitable
might as well be done quickly. And I don’t see that your
equanimity is at all impaired.”</p>

<p>“Equanimity! Nonsense! Doesn’t enter the question.”
He stood, as was his habit, with legs stretched far apart, rocking
to and fro a little, and regarding his gleaming boots.
“What has equanimity to do with it? We’re cultivated people.
I’m neither a tiger nor a Philistine. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nihil humanum a me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
alienum</span>, et cetera. You simply don’t know me. And
it doesn’t astonish me, for what chance have we ever had to
cultivate each other’s acquaintance? Marriage gave us no
opportunity. We should retrieve our lost occasions. It is this
wish that I should like to take with me into my renewed
bachelorhood. You must promise not to avoid me as rigorously
in the future as you did during the eight months of our
married life.”</p>

<p>“If it will give you any pleasure, I promise gladly,” Judith
answered good-humouredly.</p>

<p>With that they parted.</p>

<p>An hour later Felix Imhof sat in the train. With protruding
eyes he stared at the passing landscape until darkness fell.
He desired conversation, argument, the relief of some projection
of his inner self. With wrinkled brow he watched the
strangers about him who knew nothing of him or his inner
wealth, of his great, rolling ideas, or his far-reaching
plans.</p>

<p>At Düsseldorf he left the train. He had made up his
mind to do so at the last possible moment. He checked his
luggage, and huddled in his coat, walked, a tall, lean figure,
through the midnight of the dark and ancient streets.</p>

<p>He stopped in front of one of the oldest houses. In this
house he had passed his youth. All the windows were dark.
“Hello, boy!” he shouted toward the window behind which
he had once slept. The walls echoed his voice. “O nameless
boy,” he said, “where do you come from?” He was accustomed
to say of himself often: “I am of obscure origin like
Caspar Hauser.”</p>

<p>But no secret weighed upon him, not even that of his own
unknown descent. He was a man of his decade&mdash;stripped of
mystery, open to all the winds.</p>

<p>He entered a house, which he remembered from his student
days. In a large room, lined with greasy mirrors, there were
fifteen or twenty half-dressed girls. In his hat and coat he sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
down at the piano and played with the false energy of the
dilettante.</p>

<p>“Girls,” he said, “I’ve got a mad rage in me!” The girls
played tricks on him as he sat there. They hung a crimson
shawl over his shoulders and danced.</p>

<p>“I’m in a rage, girls,” he repeated. “It’s got to be drowned
out.” He ordered champagne by the pailful.</p>

<p>The doors were locked. The girls screeched with delight.</p>

<p>“Do something to relieve my misery, girls,” he commanded,
bade half a dozen stand in a row and open their mouths. Then
he rolled up hundred mark notes like cigarettes, and stuck
them between the girls’ teeth. They almost smothered him
with their caresses.</p>

<p>And he drank and drank until he lost consciousness.</p>


<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>Christian could not be without Eva. If he left her for the
shortest period, the world about him grew dark.</p>

<p>Yet all their relations had the pathos of farewells. If he
walked beside her, it seemed to be for the last time. Every
touch of their hands, every meeting of their eyes had the dark
glow and pain of the irrevocable.</p>

<p>His love for her was in harmony with this condition. It
was clinging, giving, patient, at times even obedient.</p>

<p>It showed its nature in the way he held her cloak for her,
gave her a glass that her lips were to touch, supported her
when she was weary, waited for her if she was later than he
at some appointed spot.</p>

<p>She felt that often and questioned him; but he had no
answer. He might have conveyed his sensation of an eternal
farewell, but he could not have told her what was to follow it.
And it became very clear to him, that not a farewell from her
alone was involved, but a farewell from everything in the world
that had hitherto been clear and pleasant and indispensable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
him. Beyond that fact he understood nothing; he had no plans
and did not make any.</p>

<p>He was so void of any desire or demand that Eva yielded
recklessly to a hundred wishes, and was angry when none
remained unfulfilled. She wanted to see the real ocean. He
rented a yacht, and they cruised on the Atlantic for two
weeks. She had a longing for Paris, and he took her there in
his car. They had dinner at Foyot in the Rue de Tournon,
where they had invited friends&mdash;writers, painters, musicians.
On the following day they returned. They heard of a castle
in Normandy which was said to be like a dream of the early
Middle Age. She desired to see it by moonlight; so they set
out while the moon was full and cloudless nights were expected.
Then the cathedral at Rouen lured her; next the famous roses
of a certain Baron Zerkaulen near Ghent; then an excursion
into the forest of Ardennes, or a sunset over the Zuyder Zee,
or a ride in the park at Richmond, or a Rembrandt at The
Hague, or a festive procession in Antwerp.</p>

<p>“Do you never get tired?” Christian asked one day, with
that unquiet smile of his that seemed a trifle insincere.</p>

<p>Eva answered: “The world is big and youth is brief. Beauty
yearns toward me, exists for me, and droops when I am gone.
Since Ignifer is mine, my hunger seems insatiable. It is radiant
over my earth, and makes all my paths easy. You see, dear,
what you have done.”</p>

<p>“Beware of Ignifer,” said Christian, with that same, apparently
secretive smile.</p>

<p>Eva’s lids drooped heavily. “Fyodor Szilaghin has arrived,”
she said.</p>

<p>“There are so many,” Christian answered, “I can’t possibly
know them all.”</p>

<p>“You see none, but they all see you,” said Eva. “They all
wonder at you and ask: Who is that slender, distinguished man
with very white teeth and blue eyes? Do you not hear their
whispering? They make me vain of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do they know of me? Let them be.”</p>

<p>“Women grow pale when you approach. Yesterday on the
promenade there was a flower-seller, a Flemish girl. She
looked after you, and then she began to sing. Did you not
hear?”</p>

<p>“No. What was the song she sang?”</p>

<p>Eva covered her eyes with her hands, and sang softly and
with an expression on her lips that was half pain and half
archness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“‘Où sont nos amoureuses?</div>
       <div class="verse">Elles sont au tombeau,</div>
       <div class="verse">Dans un séjour plus beau</div>
       <div class="verse">Elles sont heureuses.</div>
       <div class="verse">Elles sont près des anges</div>
       <div class="verse">Au fond du ciel bleu,</div>
       <div class="verse">Où elles chantent les louanges</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>“It touched my very soul, and for a minute I hated you.
Ah, how much beauty of feeling streams from human hearts,
and finds no vessel to receive it!”</p>

<p>Suddenly she arose, and said with a burning glance: “Fyodor
Szilaghin is here.”</p>

<p>Christian went to the window. “It is raining,” he said.</p>

<p>Thereupon Eva left the room, singing with a sob in her
throat:</p>

<div class="poetry-container" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Où sont nos amoureuses?</div>
       <div class="verse">Elles sont au tombeau.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That evening they were walking down the beach. “I met
Mlle. Gamaleja,” Eva told him. “Fyodor Szilaghin introduced
her to me. She is a Tartar and his mistress. Her beauty is like
that of a venomous serpent, and as strange as the landscape of
a wild dream. There was a silent challenge in her attitude to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
me, and a silent combat arose between us. We talked about
the diary of Marie Bashkirtseff. She said that such creatures
should be strangled at birth. But I see from your expression,
dear man, that you have never heard of Marie Bashkirtseff.
Well, she was one of those women who are born a century
before their time and wither away like flowers in February.”</p>

<p>Christian did not answer. He could not help thinking of the
faces of the dead fishermen which he had seen the night before.</p>

<p>“Mlle. Gamaleja was in London recently and brought me a
message from the Grand Duke,” Eva continued; “he’ll be here
in another week.”</p>

<p>Christian was still silent. Twelve women and nineteen children
had stood about the dead men. They had all been scantily
clad and absorbed in their icy grief.</p>

<p>They walked up the beach and moved farther away from the
tumult of the waves. Eva said: “Why don’t you laugh? Have
you forgotten how?” The question was like a cry.</p>

<p>Christian said nothing. “To-morrow,” she remarked swiftly,
and caught her veil which was fluttering in the breeze, “to-morrow
there’s a village fair at Dudzeele. Come with me to
Dudzeele. Pulcinello will be there. We will laugh, Christian,
laugh!”</p>

<p>“Last night there was a storm here,” Christian began at
last. “You know that, for we were long among the dunes up
there. Toward morning I walked toward the beach again, because
I couldn’t sleep. Just as I arrived they were carrying
away the bloated corpses of the fishermen. Three boats went
to pieces during the night; it was quite near Molo, but there
was no chance for help. They carried seven men away to the
morgue. Some people, all humble folk, went along, and so did
I. There in that death chamber a single lantern was burning,
and when they put down the drenched bodies, puddles gathered
on the floor. Coats had been spread over the faces of the
dead men; and of the women I saw but a single one shed tears.
She was as ugly as a rotten tree-trunk; but when she wept all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
her ugliness was gone. Why should I laugh, Eva? Why
should I laugh? I must think of the fishermen who earn their
bread day after day out on the sea. Why should I laugh? And
why to-day?”</p>

<p>With both hands Eva pressed her veil against her cheeks.</p>

<p>In that tone of his, which was never rudely emphatic, Christian
continued: “Yesterday at the bar Wiguniewski and Botho
Thüngen showed me a man of about fifty, a former star at the
opera, who had been famous and made money in his day. The
day before he had broken down on the street&mdash;from starvation.
But in his pocket, they found twenty francs. When he
was asked why, having the money, he had not satisfied his
hunger, he answered that the money was an advance given him
toward travelling expenses. He had been engaged to sing at a
cabaret in Havre. It had taken him months to find this employment.
But the fare to Havre is thirty-five francs, and for six
days he had made frantic efforts to scrape together the additional
fifteen francs. He had resisted every temptation to
touch the twenty francs, for he knew that if he took but a
single centime his life would be finally wrecked. But on this
day the date of the beginning of his engagement had lapsed,
and he returned the twenty francs to the agent. They pointed
this man out to me. Leaning on his arms, he sat before an
empty cup. I meant to sit down by him, but he went away.
Why should I laugh, Eva, when there are such things to think
about? Don’t ask me to-day of all days that I should laugh.”</p>

<p>Eva said nothing. But when they were at home, she flung
herself in his arms, as though beside herself, and said: “I
must kiss you.”</p>

<p>And she kissed him and bit his lip so hard that drops of
blood appeared.</p>

<p>“Go now,” she said with a commanding gesture, “go! But
don’t forget that to-morrow we shall visit the fair at Dudzeele.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>


<h3>XX</h3>

<p>They drove to the fair and made their way through the
crowds to the little puppet-show. The benches were filled with
children; the grown people stood in a semi-circle. From the
harbour floated the odours of machine oil, leather, and salt
herring; in the air resounded the discords of all kinds of music
and of the criers’ voices.</p>

<p>Christian made a path for Eva; half-surprised and half-morosely
the people yielded. Eva followed the play with cheerful
intensity. She had loved such scenes from childhood, and
now they brought back to her with a poignant and melancholy
glow the years of her obscure wanderings.</p>

<p>The Pulcinello, who played the rôle of an outwitted cheat,
was forced to confess that no cunning could withstand the
magic of the good fairies. His simplicity was too obvious,
and his downfall too well deserved to awaken compassion. The
rain of blows which were his final portion constituted a satisfying
victory of good morals.</p>

<p>Eva applauded, and was as delighted as a child. “Doesn’t
it make you laugh, Christian?” she asked.</p>

<p>And Christian laughed, not at the follies of the rogue, but
because Eva’s laughter was so infectious.</p>

<p>When the curtain had fallen upon the tiny stage, they followed
the stream of people from one amusement to another. A
little line of followers was formed in their wake; a whispering
passed from mouth to mouth and each pointed out Eva to
the other. Several young girls seemed especially stubborn in
their desire to follow the exquisitely dressed lady. Eva wore
a hat adorned with small roses and a cloak of silk as blue
as the sea in sunshine.</p>

<p>One of the maidens had gathered a bunch of lilacs, and in
front of an inn she gave the flowers to Eva with a dainty
courtesy. Eva thanked her, and held the flowers to her face.
Five or six of the girls formed a circle about her, and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
each others’ hands and danced and trilled a melody of wild
delight.</p>

<p>“Now I am caught,” Eva cried merrily to Christian, who
had remained outside of the circle and had to endure the
mocking glances of the girls.</p>

<p>“Yes, now you are caught,” he answered, and sought to
put himself in tune with the mood of the merrymakers.</p>

<p>On the steps of the inn stood a drunken fellow, who watched
the scene before him with inexplicable fury. First he exhausted
himself in wild abuse, and when no one took notice of
him, he seemed overcome by a sort of madness. He picked
up a stone from the ground, and hurled it at the group. The
girls cried out and dodged. The stone, as large as a man’s
fist, narrowly missed the arm of the girl who had presented
the flowers, and in its fall hit both of Eva’s feet.</p>

<p>She grew pale and compressed her lips. Several men rushed
up to the drunken brute, who staggered into the inn. Christian
had also run in that direction; but he turned back, thinking it
more important to take care of Eva. The girls surrounded
her, sympathized and questioned.</p>

<p>“Can you walk?” he asked. She said yes with a determined
little air, but limped when she tried. He caught her up in his
arms, and carried her to the car, which was waiting nearby.
The girls followed and waved farewell with their kerchiefs.
Hoarse cries sounded from the inn.</p>

<p>“Pulcinello grew quite mad,” Eva said. She smiled and
suppressed all signs of pain. “It is nothing, darling,” she
whispered after a while, “it will pass. Don’t be alarmed.”
They drove with racing speed.</p>

<p>Half an hour later she was resting in an armchair in the villa.
Christian was kneeling before her, and held her naked feet
in his hands.</p>

<p>Susan had been quite terror stricken, when she had whisked
off her mistress’s shoes and stockings, and saw to her horror
the red bruises made by the stone. She had stammered out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
contradictory counsels, had summoned the servants, and excitedly
cried out for a physician. At last Eva had asked her
to be quiet and to leave the room.</p>

<p>“The pain’s almost gone,” said Eva, and nestled her little
feet luxuriously into Christian’s cool hands. A maid brought
in a ewer of water and linen cloths for cold bandages.</p>

<p>Christian held and regarded those two naked feet, exquisite
organs that were comparable to the hands of a great painter or
to the wings of a bird that soars far and high. And while he
was taking delight in their form, the clearly defined net of
muscles, the lyrical loveliness of the curves, the rosy toes
with their translucent nails, an inner monitor arose in him
and seemed to say: “You are kneeling, Christian, you are
kneeling.” Silently, and not without a certain consternation,
he had whispered back: “Yes, I am kneeling, and why should
I not?” His eyes met Eva’s, and the gleam of delight in hers
heightened his inner discomfort.</p>

<p>Eva said: “Your hands are dear physicians, and it is
wonderful to have you kneel before me, sweet friend.”</p>

<p>“What is there wonderful about it?” Christian asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>The twilight had fallen. Through the gently waving curtains
the evening star shone in.</p>

<p>Eva shook her head. “I love it. That’s all.” Her hair
fell open and rippled down her shoulders. “I love it,” she
repeated, and laid her hands on his head, pressing it toward
her knees. “I love it.”</p>

<p>“But you are kneeling!” Christian heard that voice again.
And suddenly he saw a water jug with a broken handle, and
a crooked window rimmed with snow, and a single boot crusted
with mud, and a rope dangling from a beam, and an oil lamp
with a sooty chimney. He saw these lowly, poverty-stricken
things.</p>

<p>“Have you kneeled to many as though you adored them?”
Eva asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not answer, but her naked feet grew heavy in his
hands. The sensuous perception which they communicated to
him through their warmth, their smoothness, their instinctive
flexibility vanished suddenly, and gave way to a feeling in
which fear and shame and mournfulness were blended. These
human organs, these dancing feet, these limbs of the woman
he loved, these rarest and most precious things on earth seemed
suddenly ugly and repulsive to him, and those lowly and
poverty-stricken objects&mdash;the jug with the broken handle, the
crooked window with its rim of snow, the muddy boot, the
dangling rope, the sooty lamp, these suddenly seemed to him
beautiful and worthy of reverence.</p>

<p>“Tell me, have you kneeled to many?” he heard Eva’s voice,
with its almost frightened tenderness. And it seemed to him
that Ivan Becker gave answer in his stead and said: “That you
kneeled down before her&mdash;that was it, and that alone. All else
was hateful and bitter; but that you kneeled down beside her&mdash;ah,
that was it!”</p>

<p>He breathed deeply, with closed eyes, and became pale. And
he relived, more closely and truly than ever, that hour of
fate. He felt the breath of Becker’s kiss upon his forehead,
and understood its meaning. He understood the feverish
transformations of an evil conscience that had caused him to
identify himself with that jug, that window, that boot and
rope and lamp, only to flee, only to gain time. And he understood
now that despite his change from form to form, he had
well seen and heard the beggar, the woman, Ivan Michailovitch,
the sick, half-naked children, but that his whole soul had
gathered itself together in the effort to guard himself against
them for but a little while, before they would hurl themselves
upon him with all their torment, despair, madness, cruelty, like
wild dogs upon a piece of meat.</p>

<p>His respite had come to an end. With an expression of
haste and firmness at once he arose. “Let me go, Eva,” he
said, “send me away. It is better that you send me away than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
that I wrench myself loose, nerve by nerve, inch by inch.
I cannot stay with you nor live for you.” Yet in this very
moment his love for her gathered within him like a storm of
flames, and he would have torn the heart from his breast to
have unsaid the irrevocable words.</p>

<p>She sprang up swiftly as an arrow. Then she stood very still,
with both hands in her hair.</p>

<p>He walked to the window. He saw the whole space of
heaven before him, the evening star and the unresting sea.
And he knew that it was all illusion, this great peace, this
glittering star, this gently phosphorescent deep, that it was but
a garment and a painted curtain by which the soul must not
let itself be quieted. Behind it were terror and horror and
unfathomable pain. He understood, he understood at last.</p>

<p>He understood those thousands and thousands on the shore
of the Thames and their sombre silence. He understood the
shipman’s daughter, whose violated body had lain on coarse
linen. He understood Adda Castillo and her will to destruction.
He understood Jean Cardillac’s melancholy seeking for help,
and his sorrow over his wife and child. He understood that
ancient rake who cried out behind the gates of his cloister:
“What shall I do? My Lord and Saviour, what shall I do?”
He understood Dietrich, the deaf and dumb lad who had
drowned himself, and Becker’s words concerning his dripping
coat, and Franz Lothar’s horror at the intertwined bodies of the
Hungarian men and maids, and the panting hunger of Amadeus
Voss and his saying concerning the silver cord and the pitcher
broken at the fountain. He understood the stony grief of
the fishermen’s wives, and the opera singer who had twenty
francs in his pocket.</p>

<p>He understood. He understood.</p>

<p>“Christian!” Eva cried out in a tone as though she were
peering into the darkness.</p>

<p>“The night has come upon us,” Christian said, and trembled.</p>

<p>“Christian!” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly he became aware of Amadeus Voss, who emerged
out there from among the dark trees, and who seemed to have
awaited him, for he made signs to him at the window. With a
hasty good-night Christian left the room.</p>

<p>Eva looked after him and did not move.</p>

<p>A little later, forgetting the ache in her feet, she went into
her dressing-room, opened her jewel case, took Ignifer out, and
regarded the stone long and with brooding seriousness.</p>

<p>Then she put it into her hair, and went to the mirror&mdash;cool
in body, pale of face, quiet-eyed. She folded her arms, lost in
this vision of herself.</p>


<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>Christian and Amadeus walked across the dam toward Duinbergen.</p>

<p>“I have a confession to make to you, Wahnschaffe,”
Amadeus Voss began. “I’ve been gambling, playing roulette,
over at Ostende.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard about it,” said Christian absent-mindedly.
“And, of course, you lost?”</p>

<p>“The devil appeared to me,” said Amadeus, in hollow tones.</p>

<p>“How much did you lose?” Christian asked.</p>

<p>“Maybe you think it was some refined modern devil, a
hallucination, or a product of the poetic fancy,” Amadeus continued
in his breathless and strangely hostile way. “Oh, no,
it was a regular, old-fashioned devil with a goat’s beard and
great claws. And he spoke to me: ‘Take of their superfluity;
clothe your sensitiveness in armour; let them not intimidate
you, nor the breath of their insolently beautiful world
drive you into the cloudy closets of your torment.’ And with
his cunning fingers he guided the little, jumping ball for me.
The light of the lamps seemed to cry, the rouge fell from the
cheeks of the women, the spittle of poisonous greed ran down
the beards of the men. I won, Christian Wahnschaffe, I won!
Ten thousand, twelve thousand&mdash;I hardly remember how much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
The thousand franc notes looked like tatters of a faded flag.
There were gleaming halls, stairs, gardens, white tables, champagne
coolers, platters of oysters; and I breathed deep and
lived and was like a lord. Strange men congratulated me,
honoured me with their company, ate with me&mdash;experienced
people, spick and span and respectable. In the Hotel de la
Plage my goat-footed devil finally became transformed into a
worthy symbol. He became a spider that had a huge egg
between its feet and sucked insatiably.”</p>

<p>“I believe you ought to go to bed and have a long sleep,”
said Christian drily. “How much did you lose in the end?”</p>

<p>“I have lost sleep,” Amadeus admitted. “How much I
lost? About fourteen thousand. Prince Wiguniewski advanced
the money; he thought you’d return it. He’s a very distinguished
person, I must say. Not a muscle in his face moves
when he’s courteous; nothing betrays the fact that he scents
the proletarian in me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll straighten out the affair with him,” said Christian.</p>

<p>“It is not enough, Wahnschaffe,” Amadeus answered, and
his voice shook, “it is not enough!”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t it enough?”</p>

<p>“Because I must go on gambling and win the money back.
I can’t remain your debtor.”</p>

<p>“You will only increase your indebtedness, Amadeus. But
I won’t prevent you, if you’ll make up your mind to name a
limit.”</p>

<p>Amadeus laughed hoarsely. “I knew you’d be magnanimous,
Christian Wahnschaffe. Plunge the thorn deeper into my
wound. Go on!”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand you, Amadeus,” Christian said calmly.
“Ask as much money of me as you please. To be sure,
I’d prefer to have you ask it for another purpose.”</p>

<p>“How magnanimous again, how magnanimous!” Amadeus
jeered. “But suppose that naming a limit is just what I won’t
do? Suppose I want to strip off my beggar’s shame and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>come
frankly a robber? Would you cast me off in that
case?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I should do,” Christian answered.
“Perhaps I should try to convince you that you are not acting
justly.”</p>

<p>These sober and simple words made a visible impression
on Amadeus Voss. He lowered his head and, after a while,
he said: “It crushes the heart&mdash;that interval between the
hopping of the little ball and the decision of the judge. The
faded bank notes rustle up, or a round roll of gold is driven up
on a shovel. I invented a system. I divided eight letters
into groups of three and five. Once I won seventeen hundred
with my system, another time three thousand. You mustn’t
leave me in the lurch, Wahnschaffe. I have a soul, too. Three
and five&mdash;that’s my problem. I’ll break the bank. I’ll break
the bank thrice&mdash;ten times! It is possible, and therefore it can
be done. Can three and five withstand a cloudburst of gold?
Would Danaë repel Perseus, or would she demand that he
bring her first the head of the Gorgon Medusa?”</p>

<p>He fell silent very suddenly. Christian had laid an arm
about his shoulder, and this familiar caress was so new and
unexpected that Amadeus breathed deep as a child in its
sleep. “Think of what has happened, Amadeus,” said Christian.
“Do think of the words you said to me: ‘It is possible
that you need me; it is certain that without you I am lost.’
Have you forgotten so soon, dear friend?”</p>

<p>Amadeus started. He stood still and grasped Christian’s
hands: “For the love of God ... no one has ever spoken
to me thus ... no one!”</p>

<p>“You will not forget it then, Amadeus?” Christian said
softly.</p>

<p>A weakness overcame Amadeus Voss. He looked about him
with unquiet eyes, and saw a low post to which the ships’
hawsers were made fast. He sat down on it, and buried his
face in his hands. Then he spoke through his hands: “Look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
you, dear brother, I am a beaten dog; that and nothing else.
I feel as though I had leaned too long against a cold, hard,
tinted church wall. The chill has remained in my very marrow,
and I struggle because I don’t want that feeling to enslave
me. Often I think I should like to love a woman. I
cannot live without love; and yet I live on without it, day after
day. Always without love! The accursed wall is so cold. I
cannot and would not and must not live without love. I am
only human, and I must know woman’s love, or I shall freeze
to death or be turned to stone or utterly destroyed. Yet I am a
Christian, and it is hard for a Christian who bears a certain
image in his heart to give himself up to woman. Help me to
find a woman, brother, I beseech you.”</p>

<p>Christian looked out upon the dark sea. “How can I help
him?” he thought, and felt all the coldness of the world and
the confusion of mortal things.</p>

<p>While he stood and reflected he heard from afar across the
dunes a cry, first dulled by the distance, then nearer and clearer,
and then farther away again. It was such a cry as a man might
utter, at his utmost need, in the very face of death. Amadeus
Voss also lifted his head to listen. They looked at each other.</p>

<p>“We must go,” said Christian.</p>

<p>They hurried in the direction of the cry, but the dunes and
the beach were equally desolate. Thrice again they heard the
cry in the same fashion, approaching and receding, but their
seeking and listening and hurrying were in vain. When they
were about to return Voss said: “It was not human. It came
from something in nature. It was a spirit cry. Such things
happen oftener than men believe. It summons us somewhere.
One of us two has received a summons.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said Christian, smiling. His sense for reality
could accept such an interpretation of things only in jest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>


<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>On his way to Scotland Crammon stopped over for a day in
Frankfort. He informed Christian’s mother of his presence,
and she begged him with friendly urgency to come to her.</p>

<p>It was the end of June. They had tea on a balcony wreathed
in fresh green. Frau Wahnschaffe had ordered no other callers
to be admitted. For a while the conversation trickled along
indifferently, and there were long pauses. She wanted Crammon
to give her some news of Christian, from whom she had
not heard since he had left Christian’s Rest. But first, since
Crammon was a confidant and a witness in the suit, it was
necessary to mention Judith’s divorce and approaching remarriage
to Edgar Lorm, and Frau Wahnschaffe’s pride rebelled
at touching on things that could, nevertheless, not be silently
passed over.</p>

<p>She sought a starting point in vain. Crammon, outwardly
smooth, but really in a malicious and woodenly stubborn
mood, recognized her difficulty, but would do nothing to help
her.</p>

<p>“Why do you stay at a hotel, Herr von Crammon?” she
asked. “We have a right to you and it isn’t nice of you to
neglect us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t grudge an old tramp his freedom, dear lady,” Crammon
answered, “and anyhow it would give me a heartache to
have to leave this magic castle after just a day.”</p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe nibbled at a biscuit. “Anything is better
than a hotel,” she said. “It’s always a bit depressing, and
not least so when it’s most luxurious. And it isn’t really nice.
You are next door to quite unknown people. And the noises!
But, after all, what distinction in life is there left to-day? It’s
no longer in fashion.” She sighed. Now she thought she had
found the conversational bridge she needed, and gave herself a
jolt. “What do you think of Judith?” she said in a dull,
even voice. “A lamentable mistake. I thought her marriage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to Imhof far from appropriate and regretted it. But this!
I can hardly look my acquaintances in the face. I always
feared the child’s inordinate ambitions, her utter lack of
restraint. Now she throws herself at the head of an actor.
And to add to the painful complications, there is her bizarre
renunciation of her fortune. Incomprehensible! There’s some
secret behind that, Herr von Crammon. Does she realize clearly
what it will mean to live on a more or less limited salary?
It’s incomprehensible.”</p>

<p>“You need have no anxiety,” Crammon assured her.
“Edgar Lorm has a princely income and is a great artist.”</p>

<p>“Ah, artists!” Frau Wahnschaffe interrupted him, with a
touch of impatience and a contemptuous gesture. “That means
little. One pays them; occasionally one pays them well. But
they are uncertain people, always on the knife’s edge. It’s
customary now to make a great deal of them, even in our
circles. I’ve never understood that. Judith will have to
pay terribly for her folly, and Wahnschaffe and I are suffering
a bitter disappointment.” She sighed, and looked at
Crammon surreptitiously before she asked with apparent indifference,
“Did you hear from Christian recently?”</p>

<p>Crammon said that he had not.</p>

<p>“We have been without news of him for two months,”
Frau Wahnschaffe added. Another shy glance at Crammon
told her that he could not give her the information she sought.
He was not sufficiently master of himself at this moment to
conceal the cause of his long and secret sorrow.</p>

<p>A peacock proudly passed the balcony, spread the gleaming
magnificence of his feathers in the sunlight, and uttered a
repulsive cry.</p>

<p>“I’ve been told that he’s travelling with the son of the forester,”
said Crammon, and pulled up his eyebrows so high
that his face looked like the gargoyle of a mediæval devil.
“Where he has gone to, I can only suppose; but I have no
right to express such suppositions. I hope our paths will cross.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
We parted in perfect friendship. It is possible that we shall
find each other again on the same basis.”</p>

<p>“I have heard of the forester’s son,” Frau Wahnschaffe
murmured. “It’s strange, after all. Is it a very recent friendship?”</p>

<p>“Yes, most recent. I have no explanation to offer. There’s
nothing about a forester’s son that should cause one any
anxiety in itself; but one should like to know the character of
the attraction.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes hideous thoughts come to me,” said Frau Wahnschaffe
softly, and the skin about her nose turned grey.
Abruptly she bent forward, and in her usually empty eyes there
arose so sombre and frightened a glow, that Crammon suddenly
changed his entire opinion of this woman’s real nature.</p>

<p>“Herr von Crammon,” she began, in a hoarse and almost
croaking voice, “you are Christian’s friend; at least, you
caused me to believe so. Then act the part of a friend. Go to
him; I expect it of you; don’t delay.”</p>

<p>“I shall do all that is in my power,” Crammon answered.
“It was my intention to look him up in any event. First I’m
going to Dumbarton for ten days. Then I shall seek him out.
I shall certainly find him, and I don’t believe that there is any
ground for real anxiety. I still believe that Christian is under
the protection of some special deity; but I admit that it’s just
as well to see from time to time whether the angel in question
is fulfilling his duties properly.”</p>

<p>“You will write me whatever happens,” Frau Wahnschaffe
said, and Crammon gave his promise. She nodded to him when
he took his leave. The glow in her eyes had died out, and
when she was alone she sank into dull brooding.</p>

<p>Crammon spent the evening with acquaintances in the city.
He returned to the hotel late, and sat awhile in the lobby,
immovable, unapproachable, nourishing his misanthropy on
the aspect of the passersby. Then he examined the little directory
on which the names of the guests appeared. “What are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
these people doing here?” he asked himself. “How important
that looks: ‘Max Ostertag (retired banker) and wife.’ Why
Ostertag of all things? Why Max? Why: and wife?”</p>

<p>Embittered he went up to his room. Embittered and world-weary
he wandered up and down the long corridor. In front
of each door, both to the right and to the left, stood two
pairs of boots&mdash;one pair of men’s and one pair of women’s. In
this pairing of the boots he saw a boastful and shameless exhibitionism
of marital intimacies; for the shape and make of
the boots assured him of the legal and officially blameless status
of their owners. He seemed to see in those boots a morose
evidence of overlong, stale unions, a vulgar breadth of tread
caused by the weight of money, a commonness of mind, a self-righteous
Pharisaism.</p>

<p>He couldn’t resist the foolish temptation of creating confusion
among the boots of these Philistines. He looked about
carefully, took a pair of men’s boots, and joined them to a
pair of women’s boots at another door. And he continued
until the original companionship of the boots was utterly destroyed.
Then he went to bed with a pleasant sensation, comparable
to that of a writer of farces who has succeeded in
creating an improbable and scarcely extricable confusion amid
the puppets of his plot.</p>

<p>In the morning he was awakened by the noise of violent and
angry disputes in the hall. He raised his head, listened with
satisfaction, smiled slothfully, stretched himself, yawned, and
enjoyed the quarrelling voices as devoutly as though they were
music.</p>


<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>When on the day after his nocturnal wandering Christian
came to see Eva, he was astonished to find her surrounded by
a crowd of Russians, Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Belgians.
Until this day she had withdrawn herself from society entirely,
or else had received only at hours previously agreed upon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>tween
Christian and herself. This unexpected change suddenly
made a mere guest of him, and pushed him from the centre
to the circumference of the circle.</p>

<p>The conversation turned on the arrival of Count Maidanoff,
and there was a general exchange of speculation, both in regard
to the duration and the purpose of his visit. A political setting
of the stage had been feigned with conscious hypocrisy.
There was to be a visit to the king, and ministerial conferences.
He had first stopped at the Hotel Lettoral in Knocke,
but had soon moved to the large and magnificent Villa Herzynia,
which his favourite and friend, Prince Szilaghin, had
rented.</p>

<p>Szilaghin appeared soon after Christian. Wiguniewski, obviously
under orders, introduced the two men.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a few friends with me to-morrow night,”
Szilaghin said, with the peculiar courtesy of a great comedian.
“I trust you will do me the honour of joining us.” Coldly he
examined Christian, whose nerves grew painfully taut under
that glance. He bowed and determined not to go.</p>

<p>Eva was in the room that gave on the balcony, and was
posing for the sculptress, Beatrix Vanleer. The latter sat with
a block of paper and made sketches. Meantime Eva chatted
with several gentlemen. She held out her hand for Christian
to kiss, and ignored his questioning gaze.</p>

<p>In her cinnamon dress, with her hair high on her head and a
diadem of ivory, she seemed extraordinarily strange to him.
Her face had the appearance of delicate enamel. About her
chin there was a hostile air. Gentle vibrations about the
muscles at her temples seemed to portend an inner storm.
But these perceptions were fleeting. What Christian felt about
her was primarily a paralyzing coldness.</p>

<p>When Mlle. Vanleer had finished for the day, Eva walked
up and down talking to a certain young Princess Helfersdorff.
She led her to the balcony, which was bathed in the sunlight,
and then into her boudoir, where she liked to be when she read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
or rested from her exercises. Christian followed the two
women, and felt, for the first time in his life, that he was being
humiliated. But it did not depress him as profoundly as, an
hour ago, the mere thought of such an experience would have
done.</p>

<p>The Marquis Tavera joined him. Standing on the threshold
of the boudoir, they talked of indifferent things. Christian
heard Eva tell the young princess that she expected to go to
Hamburg within a week. The North German Lloyd was
planning a great festivity on the occasion of the launching of
a magnificent ship, and she had been asked to dance. “I’m
really delighted at the prospect,” she added cheerfully. “I’m
little more than a name to most Germans yet. Now they’ll be
able to see me and tell me what I amount to and where I
belong.”</p>

<p>The young lady looked at the dancer with enthusiasm.
Christian thought: “I must speak to her at once.” In every
word of Eva’s he felt an arrow of hostility or scorn aimed at
him. He left Tavera, and entered the room. The decisiveness
of his movement forced Eva to look at him. She smiled in
surprise. A scarcely perceptible shrug marked her astonishment
and censure.</p>

<p>Tavera had turned to the princess, and when these two
moved toward the door, Eva seemed inclined to follow them.
A gesture of Christian, which she saw on glancing back, determined
her to wait. Christian closed the door, and Eva’s
expression of amazement became intense. But he felt that this
was but acting. He slipped into a sudden embarrassment, and
could find no words.</p>

<p>Eva walked up and down, touching some object here and
there. “Well?” she asked, and looked at him coldly.</p>

<p>“This Szilaghin is an insufferable creature,” Christian murmured,
with lowered eyes. “I remember I once saw a mani-coloured
marine animal in an aquarium. It was very beautiful
and also extremely horrible. I couldn’t get rid of its image.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
I wanted constantly to go back to it, and yet felt constantly an
ugly horror of it.”</p>

<p>“O la, la!” said Eva. Nothing else. And in this soft exclamation
there was contempt, impatience, and curiosity. Then
she stood before him. “I am not fond of being caged,” she
said in a hard voice. “I am not fond of being caught and
isolated from my guests to be told trivial things. You must
forgive me, but it doesn’t interest me what impression Prince
Szilaghin makes on you. Or, to be quite truthful, it interests
me no longer.”</p>

<p>Christian looked at her dumbly. It seemed to him that he
was being chastised, beaten, and he turned very pale. The
feeling of humiliation grew like a fever. “He invited me to
his house to-morrow,” he stammered, “and I merely wanted
to tell you that I’m not going.”</p>

<p>“You must go,” Eva replied swiftly. “I beg of you to go.”
Avoiding the astonished question in his eyes, she added:
“Maidanoff will be there. I wish you to see him.”</p>

<p>“For what reason?”</p>

<p>“You are to know what I grasp at, what I do, whither I
go. Can you read faces? I dare say not. Nevertheless,
come!”</p>

<p>“What have you determined on?” he asked, awkwardly and
shyly.</p>

<p>She gave her body a little, impatient shake. “Nothing
that was not settled long ago,” she answered, with a glassy
coolness in her voice. “Did you think that I would drag on
our lovely, wild May into a melancholy November? You
might have spared us both your frankness of last night. The
dream was over no moment sooner for you than for me. You
should have known that. And if you did not know it, you
should have feigned that knowledge. A gentleman of faultless
taste does not throw down his cards while his partner is preparing
to make a last bet. You do not deserve the honourable
farewell that I gave you. I should have led you about,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
chained, like those stupid little beasts who are always whining
for permission to ruin themselves for my sake. They call this
thing their passion. It is a fire like any other; but I would
not use it to kindle a lamp, if I needed light to unlace my
shoes.”</p>

<p>She had crossed her arms and laughed softly, and moved
toward the door.</p>

<p>“You have misunderstood me,” said Christian overwhelmed.
“You misunderstand me wholly.” He raised his hands and
barred her way. “Do you not understand? If I had words....
But I love you so! I cannot imagine life without you.
And yet (how shall I put it into words?) I feel like a man who
owes colossal sums and is constantly dunned and tormented,
and does not know wherewith to pay nor whom. Do try to
understand! I was hasty, foolish. But I thought that you
might help me.”</p>

<p>It was the cry of a soul in need. But Eva did not or would
not heed it. She had built of her love a soaring arch. She
thought it had fallen, and no abyss seemed deep enough for
its ruins to be hurled. She had neither ears now nor eyes.
She had decided her fate even now; and though it frightened
her, to recede was contrary to her pride and her very blood. A
sovereign gesture silenced Christian. “Enough!” she said.
“Of all the ugly things between two people, nothing is uglier
than an explanation that involves the emotions. I have no
understanding for hypochondria, and epilogues bore me. As
for your creditors, see that you seek them out and pay them.
It is troublesome to keep house with unpaid bills.”</p>

<p>She went from the room.</p>

<p>Christian stood very still. Slowly he lowered his head, and
hid his face in his hands.</p>


<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>Next day Christian received a telegram from Crammon, in
which the latter announced his arrival for the middle of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
following week. He gazed meditatively at the slip of paper,
and had to reconstruct an image of Crammon from memory,
feature by feature. But it escaped him again at once.</p>

<p>At Fyodor Szilaghin’s he found about twenty people. There
were eight or ten Russians, including Wiguniewski. Then there
were the brothers Maelbeek, young Belgian aristocrats, a
French naval captain, Tavera, Bradshaw, the Princess Helfersdorff
and her mother (a very common looking person), Beatrix
Vanleer, and Sinaide Gamaleja.</p>

<p>Christian arrived a little later than the others, and Szilaghin
was half-sitting, half-lying on a <i>chaise-longue</i>. A young wolf
crouched on his knees, and on the arm of the <i>chaise-longue</i>
sat a green parrot. He smiled and excused himself for not
arising, pointing to the animals as though they held him fast.</p>

<p>From Wiguniewski’s anecdotes Christian knew of Szilaghin’s
fondness for such trickery. At Oxford he had once gone boating
alone and at night with an eagle chained to his skiff; at
Rome he had once rented a palace, and given a ball to the
dregs of the city’s life&mdash;beggars, cripples, prostitutes, and
pimps. The boastfulness of such things was obvious. But as
Christian stood there and saw him with those animals, the
impression he received was not only one of frantic high spirits,
but also one of despair. A retroactive oppression crept over
him.</p>

<p>The lighting of the rooms was strikingly dim and scattered.
A thunderstorm was approaching, and the windows were all
open on account of the sultry heat; and every flicker of lightning
flashed an unexpected brightness into the rooms.</p>

<p>At the invitation of several guests, Sinaide Gamaleja sat
down with a lute under a cluster of long-stemmed roses, and
began to sing a Russian song. Over her shoulders lay a gold-embroidered
shawl, and her hair was held by a band of diamonds.
Her figure was fragile. She had broad cheekbones, a
wide mouth, and dully-glowing, heavy-lidded eyes.</p>

<p>The greyish-yellow wolf on Szilaghin’s knees raised his head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and blinked sleepily at the singer. The melody had awakened
in him a dream of his native steppes. But the parrot stirred
too, and, croaking an unintelligible word, he preened himself
and displayed the gorgeous plumage of his throat. Szilaghin
raised a finger and bade the bird be silent; obediently it hid
its beak in the feathers which a breeze lifted. A voluble old
Russian kept talking to Szilaghin. The latter overheard him
contemptuously, and joined in the singing of the song’s second
stanza.</p>

<p>His voice was melodious&mdash;a deep, dark baritone. But to
Christian there seemed something corrupt in its music, as corrupt
as the half-shut, angry, melancholy eyes with their contempt
of mankind; as corrupt as the well-chiselled, waxen face,
that could pass for eighteen, yet harboured all the experiences
of an evil old age; as corrupt as the long, pale, sinuous, nerveless
hand or the sweetish, weary, clever smile.</p>

<p>The Maelbeeks, Wiguniewski, the Captain, and Tavera had
settled down to a game of baccarat in the adjoining room. In
the pauses of the singing, one could hear the click of gold and
the tap of the cards on the table. These strange noises excited
the parrot; he forgot the command of his master, and uttered
a discordant cry. Sinaide Gamaleja threw the animal a furious
glance, and for a moment her hand twitched on the strings.</p>

<p>At that moment Szilaghin arose, grasped the bird’s feet with
one hand, its head with the other, and twisted the head of the
screaming, agonizedly fluttering animal around and around as
on an axis. Then he tossed the green, dead thing aside with an
expression of disgust, and calmly intoned the third stanza
of the song.</p>

<p>A flame of satisfaction appeared in Sinaide Gamaleja’s eyes.
The old Russian, who had visited his endless babble on the
sculptress, fell suddenly silent. The wolf yawned, and, as
though to confirm the fact of his own obedience, snuggled his
chin against his master’s arm.</p>

<p>Christian looked down at the dead bird, whose tattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
plumage gleamed in the lightning that flashed across the floor
like a fantastic emerald. Suddenly the dead animal became to
him the seal and symbol of all the corruption, vanity, unveracity,
bedizenment, and danger of all he saw and felt. He
looked at Szilaghin, at Sinaide, at the chattering dotard, at
the gamesters, and turned away. There was an acridness in his
throat and a burning in his eyes. He approached the window.
The foliage rustled out there, and the thunder pealed. And the
question arose within him: Whence does all this evil come?
Whence does it come, and why is it so hard to separate oneself
from it?</p>

<p>The night, the rain, and the storm drove him forth, lured him
out. He ached to lose himself in the darkness, far from men.
He was afraid for the first time in his life that he would shed
tears. Never, in all his conscious memory, had he wept. His
whole body was shaken by an emotional tumult such as he had
never known, and he repressed it only by using his utmost
energy. Just as he was about to touch the knob of the door, a
lackey opened it, and Maidanoff and Eva appeared on the
threshold. Christian stood quite still; but every vestige of
colour left his face.</p>

<p>A vivid stir went through the company. Szilaghin jumped
up to welcome these two. Maidanoff’s weather-beaten leanness
contrasted in a striking and sombre fashion with Eva’s
flower-like symmetry of form. She wore a garment diaphanous
as breathing; it was held to her shoulders by ropes of pearls.
Her skin had a faintly golden glow; her throat and arms
and bosom pulsed with life.</p>

<p>The vision absorbed Christian. He stared at her. His name
was spoken, with other names that were new to Maidanoff;
and still he stared at that unfathomable and fatal image.
His heart, in its sudden, monstrous loneliness, turned to ice;
he felt both wild and stricken with dumbness; the tension of
his soul became unendurable. Curious glances sought him out.
He failed to move at the proper moment, and the moan that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
arose from the confusion of his utter grief had made a thing
of mockery and scorn of him, before he fled past barren walls
and stupid lackeys into the open.</p>

<p>The rain came down in torrents. He did not call his car,
but walked along the road.</p>


<h3>XXV</h3>

<p>After losing twenty-eight thousand francs, the amount that
he had gradually borrowed from Mr. Bradshaw and Prince
Wiguniewski, Amadeus Voss got up from the gaming table, and
staggered into the open. He had a dim notion that he would
seek out Christian, to tell him that he would be able to settle
the debt within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>He went to the telegraph office, and sent a message to
Christian. Then he stood beneath a chestnut tree in bloom,
and muttered: “Brother, brother.”</p>

<p>A woman came along the road, and he joined her. But suddenly
he burst out into wild laughter, turned down a side street,
and went on alone.</p>

<p>He walked and walked for six endless hours. At two o’clock
in the morning he was in Heyst. His brain seemed to have
become an insensitive lump, incapable of light or reason.</p>

<p>Masses of dark grey clouds that floated in the sky assumed
to him the aspect of women’s bodies. The clouds, which the
hot night drove toward the north, were like cloaks over the
forms he desired. He felt an obscure yearning for all the love
in all the lands in which he had no part.</p>

<p>At the garden-gate of the villa he stopped and stared up at
Christian’s windows. They were open and showed light.
“Brother,” he muttered again, “brother!” Christian appeared
at the window. The sight of him filled Voss with a
sudden, overwhelming hatred. “Take care, Wahnschaffe!”
he cried.</p>

<p>Christian left the window, and soon appeared at the gate.
Amadeus awaited him with clenched fists. But when Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
approached, he turned and fled down the street, and
Christian looked after him. Then his steps became slower,
and Christian followed.</p>

<p>After Voss had wandered about aimlessly for a time, he felt
a torturing thirst. He happened to pass a sailors’ tavern, considered
for a moment, and entered. He ordered grog, but did
not touch the glass. Five or six men sat at various tables.
Three slept; the eyes of the others had a drunken stare. The
tavern keeper, an obese fellow with a criminal face, sat behind
the bar, and watched this elegantly attired guest, whose face
was so pale and so disturbed. He concluded that the late comer
was in a mood of despair, and beckoned to the bar-maid, a
dark-haired, dirty Walloon, to sit down by him.</p>

<p>Impudently she did so, and started to talk. He did not
understand her. She gave a coarse laugh, and put a hand on
his knee. Behind her thin and ragged bodice her breasts stirred
like animals. She had a primitive, animal odour. He turned
dizzy. Then a lust to murder stirred in him.</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket all the money he had left. There
were seventy francs&mdash;three gold and five silver coins. “The
magic numbers,” he muttered, and grew a shade paler, “three
and five!”</p>

<p>The Walloon woman turned greedy and caressing eyes upon
the coins. The tavern keeper, scenting business, dragged his
bulk forward.</p>

<p>“Strip off your clothes, and it’s yours!” said Amadeus
Voss.</p>

<p>She looked at him stupidly. The tavern keeper understood
German and translated the words. She laughed shrilly, and
pointed toward the door. Amadeus shook his head. “No;
now; here!” He was stubborn. The girl turned to her
employer, and the two consulted in whispers. Her gestures
made it evident that she cared little for the presence of the
drunken or snoring men. She disappeared behind a brown
partition that had once been yellow. The tavern keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
gathered the money on the table, waddled from window to
window to see that the red hangings covered all the panes,
and then stood guard at the door.</p>

<p>Amadeus sat there as though steeped in seething water. A
few minutes passed. Then the Walloon woman appeared
from behind the partition. The sailors looked up. One arose
and gesticulated; one uttered a wild laugh. The woman stood
with lowered eyes&mdash;stubborn, careless, rubbing one foot with
the other. She was rather fat, quite without charm, and the
lines of her body had been destroyed.</p>

<p>But to Amadeus Voss she was like a supernatural vision, and
he gazed upon her as though his whole soul was in that gaze.
His arms reached out, and his fingers became claws, and his
lips twitched. The fishermen and the tavern keeper no longer
saw the woman. They saw him. They felt fear. So unwonted
was the sight that they did not observe the opening of
the door. The tavern keeper’s whistled warning came too late.
Christian, who entered, still saw the naked woman as she hurried
toward the partition.</p>

<p>He approached Amadeus. But the latter took no notice of
him. He stared spell-bound at the spot where the woman had
stood.</p>

<p>Christian laid a hand upon his shoulder. Amadeus roused
himself from his absorption, turned slow, questioning eyes upon
his friend, and strangely uttered with his quivering lips these
words: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Est Deus in nobis; agitante calescimus illo.</span>”</p>

<p>Then he broke down, his forehead dropped on the table, and
a shudder shook his body.</p>

<p>The tavern keeper muttered morosely.</p>

<p>“Come, Amadeus,” said Christian very quietly.</p>

<p>The drunken fishermen and sailors stared.</p>

<p>Amadeus arose, and groped like a blind man for Christian’s
hand.</p>

<p>“Come, Amadeus,” Christian repeated, and his voice seemed
to make a deep impression on Voss, for he followed him without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
hesitation. The tavern keeper and the sailors accompanied
them into the street.</p>

<p>The tavern keeper said to the men with him: “Those are
what you call gentlemen. Look how they behave! It shows
you why the world is ruled so ill.”</p>

<p>“The dawn is breaking,” said one of the fishermen, and
pointed to a purple streak in the eastern heaven.</p>

<p>Christian and Amadeus likewise stared at the purple seam
of the east, and Amadeus spoke again: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Est Deus in nobis;
agitante calescimus illo.</span>”</p>

<h3>I</h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the appointed hour of the appointed day Crammon
arrived. He had prepared himself to stay and to be festive;
but he was disappointed. Eva and her train were on the
point of leaving. Maidanoff had proceeded to Paris, whither
Eva was to follow him.</p>

<p>Crammon had been informed of this new friendship of his
idol. All other news came to him too, and so he was aware that
a quarrel had arisen between Christian and Eva. He was the
more astonished to see Christian determined to follow Eva to
Hamburg.</p>

<p>They had exchanged but a few words, when the transformation
in Christian struck him. He laid his hand on the young
man’s shoulder, and asked sympathetically: “Have you nothing
to confide?”</p>

<p>He spent the evening with Wiguniewski. “It isn’t possible,”
he said; “you’re mistaken. Or else the world is topsy-turvy
and I can no longer tell a man from a woman.”</p>

<p>“I had no special liking for Wahnschaffe from the start,”
Wiguniewski confessed. “He’s too impenetrable, mysterious,
spoiled, cold, and, if you will, too German. Nevertheless I
knew from the first that he was the very man for Eva Sorel.
You couldn’t see the two together without a sense of delight&mdash;the
sort of delight that a beautiful composition gives you,
or anything that is spiritually fitting and harmonious.”</p>

<p>Crammon nodded. “He has a strange power over women,”
he said. “I’ve just had another instance which is the more remarkable
as it developed from a mere sight of his picture. At
the Ashburnhams’ in Yorkshire, where I’ve been staying, I
made the acquaintance of a Viennese girl, a banker’s daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
rather ugly, to be frank, but with a peculiar little sting and
charm and wit of her own. Not a bad figure, though rather&mdash;shall
we say scanty? Yes. Her name is Johanna Schöntag,
though that matters little. I called her nothing but Rumpelstilzkin.
That fitted her like a glove. God knows how she got
there. Her sister, a russet-haired person who looks as though
she’d jumped out of a Rubens, is married to an attaché of some
minor legation, Roumanian or Bulgarian or something like
that. The big capitalists fit their daughters into society that
way. Well, anyhow, this Rumpelstilzkin and I agreed to amuse
each other in the murky boredom of Lord and Lady Ashburnham’s
house. So one day I showed the girl a miniature of
Christian which Gaston Villiers painted for me in Paris. She
looked at the picture and her merry face grew grave, absorbed,
and she handed it back to me silently. A couple of days
later she asked to see it again, and it had the same effect on
her. She asked me about the man, and I, of course, became
very eloquent, and happened to remark, too, that I expected to
meet Christian here. She insisted at once that she must meet
him, and that I must plan to have her do so. Remember she’s
rather unapproachable as a rule, fastidious, turning up her
nose&mdash;her worst feature by the way&mdash;at things that please
most people. The request was unexpected and rather a nuisance.
One mustn’t, as you know, bring the wrong people
together and land one’s self in difficulties. So I said at once:
‘The Almighty forbid!’ I admonished her gently to change her
mind, and painted the danger in its darkest hues. She laughed
at me, and asked me whether I’d grown strait-laced; then she
at once developed a most cunning plan. She had time enough.
She wasn’t expected home till the first of November, which
gave her seven weeks. So she would announce her intention
of studying the Dutch galleries, the pursuit of culture being
always respectable. She had a companion and chaperone, as
it was, and her sister, who was broad-minded in such matters,
could be taken into her confidence. Her energy and astute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>ness
made me feel weak, and forced me into the conspiracy.
Well, she arrived yesterday. She’s at the Hotel de la Plage,
a little scared, like a bird that’s dropped out of its nest, a
little dissatisfied with herself, vexed by little attacks of morality;
and I, for my part, don’t know what to do with her. I
bethought me too late that Christian isn’t to be caught by
such tricks, and now I’ve got to make it clear to the girl. All
this is by the way, prince&mdash;a sort of footnote to your discourse,
which I did not intend to interrupt.”</p>

<p>Wiguniewski had listened with very slight sympathy. He
began again: “These past months, as I’ve said, have given
us all an unforgettable experience. We have seen two free
personalities achieving a higher form of union than any of the
legitimized ones. But suddenly this noble spectacle turns into
a shabby farce; and it is his fault. For such a union has its
organic and natural close. A man of subtle sensitiveness knows
that, and adjusts himself accordingly. Instead of that, he
actually lets it get to the point of painful scenes. He seeks
meetings that humiliate him and make him absurd. When
she is out he waits in her rooms for her return, and endures
her passing him by with a careless nod. Once he sat waiting
all night and stared into a book. He lets the Rappard woman
treat him insolently, and doesn’t seem to mind that the fruits
and flowers he sends daily are regularly refused. What is it?
What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“It points to some sorrow, and assuredly to a great sorrow
for me,” Crammon sighed. “It’s incomprehensible.”</p>

<p>“She entertained at dinner day before yesterday,”
Wiguniewski continued. “As though to mock him he was
placed at the lower end of the table. I didn’t even know the
people who sat by him. It seems to arouse a strange cruelty
in her that he doesn’t refuse to bear these humiliations; he, on
the other hand, seems to find some inexplicable lure in his
suffering. He sat down that evening in silence. Afterwards a
curious thing happened. Groups had been formed after dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
He stood a few feet from Eva and gazed at her steadily. His
face had a brooding look as he observed her. She wore Ignifer,
which is his gift, and looked like Diana with a burning star
above her forehead.”</p>

<p>“That’s excellently well put, prince,” Crammon exclaimed.</p>

<p>“The conversation touched upon many subjects without
getting too shallow. You know her admirable way of checking
and disciplining talk. Finally there arose a discussion of
Flemish literature, and some one spoke of Verhaeren. She
quoted some verses of a poem of his called ‘Joy.’ The sense
was somewhat as follows: My being is in everything that lives
about me; meadows and roads and trees, springs and shadows,
you become me, since I have felt you wholly. There was a
murmur of appreciation. She went to a shelf and took down a
volume of Verhaeren’s poems. She turned the pages, found the
poem she sought, and suddenly turned to Wahnschaffe. She
gave him the book with a gesture of command; he was to
read the poem. He hesitated for a moment, then he obeyed.
The effect of the reading was both absurd and painful. He
read like a schoolboy, low, stammering, and as though the
content were beyond his comprehension. He felt the absurdity
and painfulness of the incident himself, for his colour changed
as the ecstatic stanzas came from his lips like an indifferent
paragraph in a newspaper; and when he had finished the reading,
he laid the book aside, and left without a glance at any
one. But Eva turned to us, and said as though nothing had
happened: ‘The verses are wonderful, aren’t they?’ Yet her
lips trembled with fury. But what was her purpose? Did she
want to prove to us his inability to feel things that are beautiful
and delicate? Did she want to put him to shame, to punish
him and publicly expose the poverty of his nature? Or was it
only an impatient whim, the annoyance at his dumb watchfulness
and his searching glances? Mlle. Vanleer said later:
‘If he had read the verses like a divine poet, she would have
forgiven him.’ ‘Forgiven him what?’ I asked. She smiled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
and answered: ‘Her own faithlessness.’ There may be something
in that. At all events, you should get him out of this
situation, Herr von Crammon.”</p>

<p>“I shall do all in my power,” said Crammon, and the lines
of care about his mouth grew deeper. He wiped his forehead.
“Of course I don’t know how far my influence goes. It would
be empty boastfulness to guarantee anything. I’ve been told
too that he frequents all sorts of impossible dives with impossible
people. I could weep when I think of it. He was the
flower of modern manhood, the pride of my lengthening years,
the salt of the earth! Unfortunately he had, even when I left
him, certain attacks of mental confusion, but I put those down
to the account of that suspicious fellow, Ivan Becker.”</p>

<p>“Don’t speak of him! Don’t speak of Becker!” Wiguniewski
interrupted sharply. “Not at least in that manner, I
must beg and insist.”</p>

<p>Crammon opened his eyes very wide, and the tip of his
tongue became visible, like a red snail peering out of its shell.
He choked down his discomfort and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Wiguniewski said: “At all events you’ve given me an indication.
I never considered such a possibility. It throws a
new light on many things. It’s true, by the way, that Wahnschaffe
associates with questionable people. The queerest of
them all is Amadeus Voss, a hypocrite and a gambler. One
must not couple such persons with Ivan Becker. Becker may
have set him upon a certain road. If we assume that, a number
of incidents become clear. But anything really baneful
comes from Voss. Save your friend from him!”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen the fellow yet,” Crammon murmured. “What
you tell me, Prince, doesn’t take me quite unawares. Nevertheless,
I’m grateful. But let that scoundrel beware! May
I never drink another drop of honest wine, if he escape me!
Let me never again glance at a tempting bosom, if I don’t
grind this infamous cur to pulp. So help me!”</p>

<p>Wiguniewski arose, and left Crammon to plan his revenge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The morning sun of late September was gilding sea and
land, when Crammon entered Christian’s room. Christian was
sitting at his curved writing table. The bright blue tapestries
on the walls gleamed; chairs and tables were covered by a
hundred confused objects. Everything pointed to the occupant’s
departure.</p>

<p>“Don’t let me disturb you, dear boy; I have time enough,”
said Crammon. He swept some things from a chair, sat down,
and lit his pipe.</p>

<p>But Christian put down his pen. “I don’t know what’s the
matter with me,” he said angrily, without looking at Crammon,
“I can’t get two coherent sentences down on paper. However
carefully I think it out, by the time it’s written it sounds stiff
and silly. Have you the same experience?”</p>

<p>Crammon answered: “There are those who have the trick.
It takes, primarily, a certain impudence. You must never stop
to ask: Is that correct? Is it true? Is it well-founded?
Scribble ahead, that’s all. Be effective, no matter at what cost.
The cleverest writers are often the most stupid fellows. But
to whom are you writing? Is the haste so great? Letters
can usually be put off.”</p>

<p>“Not this time. It is a question of haste,” Christian answered.
“I have a letter from Stettner and I can’t make
out his drift. He tells me that he’s quitting the service and
leaving for America. Before he goes he wants to see me once
more. He takes ship at Hamburg on October 15. Now it fortunately
happens that I’ll be in Hamburg on that date, and I
want to let him know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see any difficulty there,” Crammon said seriously.
“All you need say is: I’ll be at such a place on such a day,
and expect or hope, et cetera. Yours faithfully or sincerely or
cordially, et cetera. So he’s going to quit? Why? And run
off to America? Something rotten in the state of Denmark?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>“He was challenged to a duel, it appears, and refused the
challenge. That’s the only reason he gives. He adds that
matters shaped themselves so that he is forced to seek a new
life in the New World. It touches me closely; I was always
fond of him. I must see him.”</p>

<p>“I’d be curious too to know what really happened,” said
Crammon. “Stettner didn’t strike me as a chap who’d lightly
run away and risk his honour. He was an exemplary officer.
I’m afraid it’s a dreary business. But I observe that it gives
you a pretext for going to Hamburg.”</p>

<p>Christian started. “Why a pretext?” He was a little
embarrassed. “I need no pretext.”</p>

<p>Crammon bent his head far forward, and laid his chin on
the ivory handle of his stick. His pipe remained artfully
poised in one corner of his mouth, and did not move as he
spoke. “You don’t mean to assert, my dearest boy, that your
conscience doesn’t require some additional motive for the trip,”
he began, like a father confessor who is about to use subtle
arguments to force a confession from a stubborn malefactor,
“and you’re not going to try to make a fool of an old boon-companion
and brother of your soul. One owes something to a
friend. You should not forget under whose auspices and
promises you entered the great world, nor what securities <i>he</i>
offered&mdash;securities of the heart and mind&mdash;who was the author
and master of your radiant entry. Even Socrates, that rogue
and revolutionary, recalled such obligations on his death bed.
There was a story about a cock&mdash;some sort of a cock, I believe.
Maybe the story doesn’t fit the case at all. No matter.
I always thought the ancients rather odious. What does matter
is that I don’t like your condition, and that others who love
you don’t like it. It rends my very heart to see you pilloried,
while people who can’t tell a stud-horse from a donkey shrug
their shoulders at you. It’s not to be endured. I’d rather we’d
quarrel and exchange shots at a distance of five paces. What
has happened to you? What has come over you? Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
stopped gathering scalps to offer your own head? The hares
and the hounds, I tell you, are diverse creatures. I understand
all things human, but the divine order must be kept intact. It’s
flying in the face of providence that you should stand at the
gate like a beggar. You used to be the one who showed others
the door; they whined and moaned after you&mdash;and that was
proper. I had an uncle who was something of a philosopher,
and he used to say: when a woman, a lawyer, and a stove are
at their hottest&mdash;turn your back to them. I’ve always done
that, and kept my peace of mind and my reputation. There are
extenuating circumstances in your case, I admit. There is but
one such woman in a century, and whoever possesses her may
well lose his reason. But even that should not apply to you,
Christian. Splendour is your natural portion: it is for you to
grant favours; at your board the honey should be fresh each
day. And now tell me what you intend to do.”</p>

<p>Christian had listened to this lengthy though wise and pregnant
discourse with great patience. At times there was a glint
of mockery or anger in his eyes. Then again he would lower
them and seem embarrassed. Sometimes he grasped the sense
of Crammon’s words, sometimes he thought of other things.
It cost him an effort to recall clearly by what right this apparently
complete stranger interfered in his life and sought to
influence his decisions. And then again he felt within himself
a certain tenderness for Crammon in the memory of common
experiences and intimate talks; but all that seemed so far
away and so estranged from the present.</p>

<p>He looked out of the window, from which the view was free
to the horizon where sea and sky touched. Far in the distance
a little white cloud floated like a white, round pillow. The
same tenderness that he felt for Crammon, he now felt for
that little cloud.</p>

<p>And as Crammon sat before him and waited for an answer,
there suddenly came into his mind the story of the ring which
Amadeus had told him. He began: “A young candidate for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Holy Orders, who was tutor to the children of a banker, fell
under the suspicion of having stolen a costly ring. He told me
the story himself, and from his words I knew that the ring,
when he saw it on the hand of his employer’s wife, aroused his
desire. In addition he loved this woman, and would have been
happy to have had something by which to remember her. But
he was utterly innocent of the disappearance of the ring, and
some time after he had left that house, his innocence received
the most striking confirmation. For the lady sent him the ring
as a gift. He was wretchedly poor, and the ring would have
meant much to him; but he went and threw it into a well,
a deep old-fashioned well. The costliest thing he had ever
possessed in life, he threw without hesitation or reflection into
a well&mdash;that’s what this man did.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, very well. Although ... no, I don’t quite
see your meaning,” said Crammon, discontentedly, and shifted
his pipe from the right to the left corner of his mouth. “What
good did the ring do the poor fool? How absurd to take something
that reaches you in a manner so delicate and discreet,
and throw it into a well? Would not a box have served, or a
drawer? There at least it could have been found. It was a
loutish trick.”</p>

<p>Crammon’s way of sitting there with his legs crossed, showing
his grey silk socks, had something about it so secure and
satiated, that it reminded one of an animal that basks in the
sun and digests its food. Christian’s disgust at his words
quieted, and was replaced by a gentle, almost compassionate
tenderness. He said: “It is so hard to renounce. You can
talk about it and imagine it; you can will it and even believe
yourself capable of it. But when the moment of renunciation
comes, it is hard, it is almost impossible to give up even the
humblest of things.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but why do you want to renounce?” Crammon murmured
in his vexation. “What do you mean exactly by renunciation?
What is it to lead to?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian said almost to himself: “I believe that one must
cast one’s ring into a well.”</p>

<p>“If you mean by that that you intend to forget our wonderful
Queen Mab, all I have to say is&mdash;the Lord help you in your
purpose,” Crammon answered.</p>

<p>“One holds fast and clings because one fears the step into
the unknown,” Christian said.</p>

<p>Crammon was silent for a few minutes and wrinkled his
forehead. Then he cleared his throat and asked: “Did you
ever hear about homœopathy? I’ll explain to you what is
meant by it. It means curing like with like. If for instance
some food has disagreed with you violently, and I give you a
drug that would, in a state of health, have sickened you even
more violently than your food&mdash;that would be a homœopathic
treatment.”</p>

<p>“So you want to cure me?” Christian asked, and smiled.
“From what and with what?”</p>

<p>Crammon moved his chair nearer to Christian’s, laid a hand
on his knees, and whispered astutely: “I’ve got something for
you, dear boy. I’ve made an exquisite find. There’s a woman
in your horoscope, as the sooth-sayers put it. Some one is
yearning for you, is immensely taken with you, and dying of
impatience to know you. And it’s something quite different,
a new type, something prickling and comical, indeterminate,
sensitive, a little graceless and small and not beautiful, but
enormously charming. She comes from the bourgeoisie at its
most obese, but she struggles with both hands and feet against
the fate of being a pearl in a trough. There’s your chance for
employment, distraction, and refreshment. It won’t be a long
affair,&mdash;an interlude of her holidays, but instructive, and, in the
homœopathic sense, sure to work a cure. For look you: Ariel,
she is a miracle, a star, the food of the gods. You can’t live
on such nourishment; you need bread. Descend, my son, from
the high tower where you still grasp after the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">miraculum cœli</i>
that once flamed on your bosom. Put it out of your mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
descend, and be contented with mortality. To-night at seven
in the dining-room of the Hotel de la Plage. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p>Christian laughed, and got up. On the table stood a vase
filled with white pinks. He took out one of the flowers, and
fastened it into Crammon’s button-hole.</p>

<p>“Is it a bargain or not?” Crammon asked severely.</p>

<p>“No, dear friend, there’s nothing in that for me,” Christian
answered, laughing more heartily. “Keep your find to yourself.”</p>

<p>The veins on Crammon’s forehead swelled. “But I’ve promised
to bring you, and you mustn’t leave me in the lurch.”
He was in a rage. “I don’t deserve such treatment, after all
the slights which you have put on me for months. You give
rights to an obscure vagabond that astonish the whole world,
and you cast aside heartlessly an old and proved friend. That
does hurt and embitter and enrage one. I’m through.”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, Bernard,” said Christian, and stooped to
pick up some blossoms that had fallen on the floor. And as he
put back the flowers into the vase, there came to him the vision
of Amadeus Voss’ white face, showing his bleeding soul and
paralyzed by desire and renunciation, even as it was turned
toward the fat, morose Walloon woman. “I don’t comprehend
your stubbornness,” he continued. “Why won’t you let me
be? Don’t you know that I bring misfortune to all who love
me?”</p>

<p>Crammon was startled. Despite Christian’s equivocal smile,
he felt a sudden twinge of superstitious fear. “Idiotic!” he
growled. He arose and took his hat, and still tried to wring
from Christian a promise for the evening. At that moment a
knock sounded at the door, and Amadeus Voss entered.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he stammered, and looked shyly at
Crammon, who had at once assumed an attitude of hostility.
“I merely wanted to ask you, Christian, whether we are going
to leave. Shall the packing be done? We must know what
to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>Crammon was furious. “Fancy the scoundrel taking such a
tone,” he thought. He could hardly force himself to assume
the grimace of courtesy that became inevitable when Christian,
quite hesitatingly, introduced them to each other.</p>

<p>Amadeus bowed like an applicant for some humble office.
His eyes behind their lenses clung to Crammon, like the
valves of an exhaust pump. He found Crammon repulsive
at once; but he thought it advisable not only to hide this feeling
but to play the part of obsequiousness. His hatred was so
immediate and so violent, that he was afraid of showing it too
soon, and stripping himself of some chance of translating it
into action.</p>

<p>Crammon sought points of attack. He treated Voss with
contempt, looked at him as though he were a wad of clothes
against the wall, neither answered him nor listened to what he
said, deliberately prolonged his stay, and paid no attention
to Christian’s nervousness. Voss continued to play the part
he had selected. He agreed and bowed, rubbed the toe of one
of his boots against the sole of the other, picked up Crammon’s
stick when the latter dropped it; but as he seemed determined
not to be the first to yield, Crammon at last took pity
on the silent wonder and torment in Christian’s face. He
waved his well-gloved left hand and withdrew. He seemed to
swell up in his rage like a frog. “Softly, Bernard,” he said to
himself; “guard your dignity, and do not step into the ordure
at your feet. Trust in the Lord who said: Vengeance is mine.”
He met a little dog on his path, and administered a kick to
it, so that the beast howled and scurried into an open cellar.</p>

<p>Across the table Christian and Voss faced each other in
silence. Voss pulled a flower from the vase, and shredded its
calyx with his thin fingers. “So that was Herr von Crammon,”
he murmured. “I don’t know why I feel like laughing.
But I can’t help it. I do.” And he giggled softly to himself.</p>

<p>“We leave to-morrow,” said Christian, held a handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
to his mouth, and breathed the delicate perfume that aroused in
him so many tender and slowly fading images.</p>

<p>Voss took a blossom, tore it in two, gazed tensely at the
parts, and said: “Fibre by fibre, cell by cell. I am done with
this life of sloth and parasitism. I want to cut up the bodies
of men and anatomize corpses. Perhaps one can get at the
seat of weakness and vulgarity. One must seek life at its
source and death at its root. The talent of an anatomist stirs
within me. Once I wanted to be a great preacher like Savonarola;
but it’s a reckless thing to try in these days. One had
better stick to men’s bodies; their souls would bring one to
despair.”</p>

<p>“I believe one must work,” Christian answered softly. “It
does not matter at what. But one must work.” He turned
toward the window. The round, white cloud had vanished; the
silver sea had sucked it up.</p>

<p>“Have you come to that conclusion?” Voss jeered. “I’ve
known it long. The way to hell is paved with work; and only
hell can burn us clean. It is well that you have learned that
much.”</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Crammon and Johanna Schöntag were sitting in a drawing-room
of the hotel. They had had dinner together. Johanna’s
companion, Fräulein Grabmeier, had already retired.</p>

<p>“You must be patient, Rumpelstilzkin,” said Crammon.
“I’m sorry to say that he hasn’t bitten yet. The bait is still
in the water.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be patient, my lord,” said Johanna, in her slightly
rough, boyish voice, and a gleam of merriment, in which charm
and ugliness were strangely blended, passed over her face.
“I don’t find it very hard either. Everything is sure to go
wrong with me in the end. If ever unexpectedly a wish of
mine is fulfilled, and something I looked forward to does happen,
I’m as wretched as I can be, because it’s never as nice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
as I thought it would be. The best thing for me, therefore, is
to be disappointed.”</p>

<p>“You’re a problematic soul,” said Crammon musingly.</p>

<p>Johanna gave a comical sigh. “I advise you, dear friend and
protector, to get rid of me by return post.” She stretched her
thin little neck with an intentionally bizarre movement. “I
simply interfere with the traffic. I’m a personified evil omen.
At my birth a lady by the name of Cassandra appeared, and I
needn’t tell you the disagreeable things that have been said of
her. You remember how when we were at target practice at
Ashburnhill I hit the bull’s-eye. Everybody was amazed,
yourself included; but I more so than any one, because it was
pure, unadulterated chance. The rifle had actually gone off
before I had taken aim. Fate gives me such small and worthless
gifts, in order to seem friendly and lull me into security.
But I’m not to be deceived. Ugh! A nun, a nun!” she interrupted
herself. Her eyes became very large, as she looked into
the garden where an Ursuline nun was passing by. Then
she crossed her arms over her bosom, and counted with extraordinary
readiness: “Seven, six, five, four, three, two,
one.” Then she laughed, and showed two rows of marvellous
teeth.</p>

<p>“Is it your custom to do that whenever a nun appears?”
Crammon asked. His interest in superstitions was aroused.</p>

<p>“It’s the proper ritual to follow. But she was gone before I
came to one, and that augurs no good. By the way, dear
baron, your sporting terminology sounds suspicious. What
does that mean: ‘he hasn’t bitten yet; the bait is still in the
water’? I beg you to restrain yourself. I’m an unprotected
girl, and wholly dependent on your delicate chivalry. If you
shake my tottering self-confidence by any more reminiscences
of the sporting world, I’ll have to telegraph for two berths on
the Vienna train. For myself and Fräulein Grabmeier, of
course.”</p>

<p>She loved these daring little implications, from which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
could withdraw quite naïvely. Crammon burst into belated
laughter, and that fact stirred her merriment too.</p>

<p>She was very watchful, and nothing escaped her attentive
eyes. She took a burning interest in the characters and actions
of people. She leaned toward Crammon and they whispered together,
for he could tell a story about each form and face that
emerged from the crowd. The chronicle of international biography
and scandal of which he was master was inexhaustible.
If ever his memory failed him, he invented or poetized a little.
He had everything at his tongue’s end&mdash;disputes concerning
inheritances, family quarrels, illegitimate descent, adulteries,
relationships of all sorts. Johanna listened to him with a smile.
She peered at all the tables and carefully observed every uncommon
detail. She picked up and pinned down, as an entomologist
does his beetles, any chance remark or roguish
expression, any silliness or peculiarity of any of these unconscious
actors of the great world or the half world.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pupils of her greyish blue eyes grew very large,
and her lips curved in a bow of childlike delight. “Who is
that?” she whispered, and thrust her chin out a little in the
direction of a door at Crammon’s back. But she at once knew
instinctively who it was. She would have known it without the
general raising of heads and softening of voices, of which she
became aware.</p>

<p>Crammon turned around and saw Eva amid a group of ladies
and gentlemen. He arose, waited until Eva glanced in his
direction, and then bowed very low. Eva drew back a little.
She had not seen him since the days of Denis Lay. She
thought a little, and nodded distantly. Then she recognized
him, kicked back her train with an incomparable grace, and,
speaking in every line before her lips moved, went up to him.</p>

<p>Johanna had arisen too. Eva remarked the little figure. She
gave Crammon to understand that he had a duty toward his
companion, and that she would not refuse an introduction to
the unknown girl, on whose face enthusiasm and homage were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
so touchingly to be seen. Crammon introduced Johanna in his
most ceremonious manner. Johanna grew pale and red and
curtsied. She seemed to herself suddenly so negligible that she
was overcome with shame. Then she tore off the three yellow
roses at her corsage, and held them out to Eva with a sudden
and yet timid gesture. Eva liked this impulse. She felt its
uniqueness and veracity, and therefore knew its value.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Christian and Amadeus wandered across the Quai Kokerill
in Antwerp.</p>

<p>A great transatlantic liner lay, silent and empty, at the
pier. The steerage passengers waited at its side for the hour
of their admission. They were Polish peasants, Russian Jews,
men and women, young ones and aged ones, children and sucklings.
They crouched on the cold stones or on their dirty
bundles. They were themselves dirty, neglected, weary, dully
brooding&mdash;a melancholy and confused mass of rags and human
bodies.</p>

<p>The mighty globe of the sun rolled blood-red and quivering
over the waters.</p>

<p>Christian and Amadeus stopped. After a while they went on,
but Christian desired to turn back, and they did so. At a
crossing near the emigrants’ camp, a line of ten or twenty
donkey-carts cut off the road. The carts looked liked bisected
kegs on wheels, and were filled with smoked mackerels.</p>

<p>“Buy mackerels!” the cart-drivers cried. “Buy mackerels!”
And they cracked their whips.</p>

<p>A few of the emigrants approached and stared hungrily;
they consulted with others, who were already looking for coins
in their pockets, until finally a few determined ones proceeded
to make a purchase.</p>

<p>Then Christian said to Voss: “Let us buy the fish and
distribute them. What do you think?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>Amadeus was ill pleased. He answered. “Do as you wish.
Great lords must have their little pleasures.” He felt uncomfortable
amid the gathering crowd.</p>

<p>Christian turned to one of the hucksters. It was difficult to
make the man understand normal French, but gradually he
succeeded. The huckster summoned the others, and there followed
excited chatter and gesticulations. Various sums were
named and considered and rejected. This process bored Christian;
it threatened to be endless. He offered a sum that represented
a considerable increase over the highest price named,
and handed his wallet to Amadeus that the men might be
paid. Then he said to the increasing throng of emigrants in
German: “The fish are yours.”</p>

<p>A few understood his words, and conveyed their meaning
to the others. Timidly they ventured forward. A woman,
whose skin was yellow as a lemon from jaundice, was the first
to touch a fish. Soon hundreds came. From all sides they
brought baskets, pots, nets, sacks. A few old men kept the
crowd in order. One of these, who wore a flowing white beard
and a long Jewish coat, bowed down thrice before Christian.
His forehead almost touched the earth.</p>

<p>A sudden impulse compelled Christian to see in person to the
just distribution of the fish. He turned up his sleeves, and
with his delicate hands threw the greasy, malodourous fish
into the vessels held out for them. He laughed as he soiled his
fingers. The hucksters and some idle onlookers laughed too.
They thought him a crazy, young Englishman out for a lark.
Suddenly his gorge rose at the odour of the fish, and even
more at the odour of these people. He smelled their clothes
and their breath, and gagged at the thought of their teeth and
fingers, their hair and shoes. A morbid compulsion forced him
to think of their naked bodies, and he shuddered at the idea
of their flesh. So he stopped, and slipped away into the
twilight.</p>

<p>His hands still reeked of the smoked fish. He walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
through the streets that had had nothing to do with his adventure
and the night seemed empty.</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss had escaped. He waited in front of the
hotel. There the line of motor cars had gathered that was to
accompany Eva on her journey to Germany. Among the
travellers were Crammon and Johanna Schöntag.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>In October the weather turned hot on the Rio de la Plata.
All day one had to stay in the house. If one opened a window,
living fire seemed to stream in. Once Letitia fainted, when she
wanted to air her stuffy room, and opened one of the wooden
shutters.</p>

<p>The only spot that offered some shade and coolness toward
evening was an avenue of palms beside the river. Sometimes,
during the brief twilight, Letitia and her young sister-in-law
Esmeralda would steal away to that place. Their road passed
the ranchos, the wretched cave-like huts in which the native
workmen lived.</p>

<p>Once Letitia saw the people of the ranchos merrily feasting
and in their best garments. She asked for the reason,
and was told that a child had died. “They always celebrate
when some one dies,” Esmeralda told her. “How sad
must their lives be to make them so in love with death.”</p>

<p>The avenue of palms was forbidden ground. When darkness
came, the bushes rustled, and furtive men slipped back
and forth. Not long before the mounted police had caught
a sailor here who was wanted for a murder in Galveston.
Somehow Letitia dreamed of him. She was sure he had
killed his man through jealousy and bore the marks of a
beautiful tragedy.</p>

<p>One evening she had met in this spot a young naval officer,
who was a guest on a neighbouring estate. Letitia exchanged
glances with him, and from that time on he sought some
way of approaching her. But she was like a prisoner, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
like a Turkish woman in a harem. So she determined to
outwit her guards; she really fell in love with the young
officer. Her imagination made an heroic figure of him, and
she began to long for him.</p>

<p>The heat increased. Letitia could not sleep at night. The
mosquitoes hummed sweetishly, and she cried like a little child.
By day she locked herself in her room, stripped off her
clothes, and lay down on the cold tiles.</p>

<p>Once she was lying thus with arms outstretched. “I’m
like an enchanted princess,” she thought, “in an enchanted
castle.”</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the door, and she heard Stephen’s
voice calling her. Idly she raised her head, and from under
her heavy lids gazed down at her naked body. “What a
bore it is,” she thought, “what a terrible bore always to be
with the same man. I want others too.” She did not answer,
and let her head droop, and rubbed her glowing cheek
against the warm skin of her upper arm. It pleased the master
of the harem out there to beg for admission; but Letitia
did not open the door.</p>

<p>After a while she heard a tumult in the yard&mdash;laughter,
the cracking of whips, the report of rifles, and the cries of
beasts in torment. She jumped up, slipped into a silk dressing
gown, opened the window that gave on the verandah, and
peered out.</p>

<p>Stephen had tied together the tails of two cats by means
of a long fuse. Along the fuse were fastened explosive bits
of firework. The hissing little rockets singed the cats’ fur,
and the glowing cord burned into their flesh. The cats tumbled
about in their agony and howled. Stephen goaded them
and followed them. His brothers, bent over the balustrade,
roared with delight. Two Indians, grave and silent, watched
from the gate.</p>

<p>Stephen had, of course, counted on Letitia’s opening the
door in her curiosity. A few great leaps, and he was beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
her. Esmeralda, who was in the plot, had at once faced
Letitia and prevented her from locking the door. White with
rage, and with raised fist, he stormed across the threshold.
She fell to her knees, and hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“Why do you beat me?” she moaned, in horror and surprise.
But he did not touch her.</p>

<p>His teeth gnashed. “To teach you to obey.”</p>

<p>She sobbed. “Be careful! It’s not only me you’re hurting
now!”</p>

<p>“Damnation, what are you saying?” He stared at her
crouching figure.</p>

<p>“You’re hurting two now.” Letitia enjoyed fooling him.
Her tears were now tears of pity for herself.</p>

<p>“Woman, is that true?” he asked. Letitia peered furtively
between her fingers, and thought mockingly: “It’s like
the last act of a cheap opera.” She nodded with a gesture of
pain, and determined to deceive him with the naval officer.</p>

<p>Stephen gave a howl of triumph, danced about, threw himself
down beside her, and kissed her arms, her shoulders, and
her neck. At the windows and doors appeared Doña Barbara,
Esmeralda, Stephen’s brothers, and the servants. He
lifted Letitia on his strong shoulders, and carried her about
on the verandah. He roared his orders: a feast was to be
prepared, an ox slaughtered, champagne to be put on ice.</p>

<p>Letitia had no qualms of conscience. She was glad to
have made a fool of him.</p>

<p>When old Gunderam learned the cause of the rejoicing
in his house, he chuckled to himself. “Fooled all the same,
my sly lawyer man. In spite of the written agreement, you
won’t get the Escurial, not for a good while, even if she has
a whole litter.” With an unappetizing, broken little comb
he smoothed his iron grey beard, and poured eau de Cologne
on his head, until his hair, which was still thick, dripped.</p>

<p>But, strangely enough, the lie that Letitia had told
in her terror turned out to be the truth. In a few days she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
was sure. Secretly she was amazed. Every morning she
stood before the mirror, and looked at herself with a strange
respect and a subtle horror. But she was unchanged. Her
mood became gently melancholy, and she threw a kiss to
her image in the glass.</p>

<p>Since they were now afraid of crossing her wishes, she was
permitted to attend a ball given by Señor and Señora Küchelbäcker,
and it was there that she made the formal acquaintance
of the naval lieutenant, Friedrich Pestel.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Felix Imhof and the painter Weikhardt met at the exhibition
of the “secessionists” in Munich. For a while they
strolled through the rooms, and looked at the paintings;
then they went out on the terrace, and sat down at a table
that commanded a view of the park.</p>

<p>It was in the early afternoon, and the odours of oil and
turpentine from within blended with the fragrance of the
sun-warmed plants.</p>

<p>Imhof crossed his long legs, and yawned affectedly. “I’m
going to leave this admirable home of art and letters for
some months,” he declared. “I’m going to accompany the
minister of colonial affairs to South West Africa. I’m anxious
to see how things are going there. Those people need
looking after. Then, too, it’s a new experience, and there
will be hunting.”</p>

<p>Weikhardt was utterly self-absorbed. He was full of his
own annoyances, his inner and outer conflicts, and therefore
spoke only of himself. “I am to copy a cycle by Luini for
the old Countess Matuschka,” he said. “She has several
blank walls in her castle in Galicia, and she wants tapestries
for them. But the old creature is close as the bark on the
tree, and her bargaining is repulsive.”</p>

<p>Imhof also pursued his own thoughts. “I’ve read a lot
about Stanhope recently,” he said. “A tremendous fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
modern through and through, reporter and conquistador at
the same time. The blacks called him the ‘cliff-breaker.’
It makes one’s mouth water. Simply tremendous!”</p>

<p>Weikhardt continued: “But I dare say I’ll have to accept
the commission. I’ve come to the end of my tether. It’ll
be good to see the old Italians again, too. In Milan there’s
a Tintoretto that’s adorable. I’m on the track of a secret.
I’m doing things that will count. The other day I finished
a picture, a simple landscape, and took it to an acquaintance
of mine. He has a rather exquisite room, and there we
hung it. The walls had grey hangings, and the furnishings
were in black and gold. He’s a rich man and wanted to
buy the picture. But when I saw how much he liked it,
and saw, too, the delicate, melancholy harmony of its colours
with the tints of the room, I felt a sudden flash of encouragement.
I couldn’t bear to talk money, and I simply
gave him the thing. He accepted it quietly enough, but
he continued saying: ‘How damned good it is!’”</p>

<p>“It’ll take my thoughts off myself, this little trip to the
Southern Hemisphere,” said Imhof. “I’m not exactly favoured
of fortune just now. To be frank&mdash;everything’s in
the deuce of a mess. My best horse went to smash, my
favourite dog died, my wife took French leave of me, and
my friends avoid me&mdash;I don’t know why. My business is
progressing backward, and all my speculations end in losses.
But, after all, what does it matter? I say to myself: Never
say die, old boy! Here’s the great, beautiful world, and all
the splendour and variety of life. If you complain, you deserve
no better. My sandwich has dropped into the mud.
All right; I must get a fresh one. Whoever goes to war
must expect wounds. The main thing is to stick to your
flag. The main thing is faith&mdash;quite simple faith.”</p>

<p>It was still a question which of the two would first turn
his attention from himself, and hear his companion’s voice.
Weikhardt, whose eyes had grown sombre, spoke again: “O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
this dumb loneliness in a studio, with one’s hundred failures,
and the ghosts of one’s thousand hours of despair! I have
a chance to marry, and I’m going to take it, too. The
girl has no money, to be sure, but she has a heart. She’s
not afraid of my poverty, and comprehends the necessary
quixotism of an artist’s life. She comes of a Protestant
family of very liberal traditions, but two years ago she
became a Catholic. When I first met her I was full of
suspicion, and assumed all sorts of reasons for her step except
the simple and human ones. It’s very difficult to see
the simple and the human things, and still more difficult
to do them. Gradually I understood what it means&mdash;to believe!
and I understood what is to be reverenced in such
faith. It is faith itself that is sacred, not that in which
the faith is placed. It doesn’t matter what one has faith
in&mdash;a book, a beast, a man, a star, a god. But it must be
pure faith&mdash;immovable and unconquerable. Yes, I quite agree
with you&mdash;we need simple faith.”</p>

<p>So they had found each other through a word. “When
do I get my picture, your Descent from the Cross?” Imhof
inquired.</p>

<p>Weikhardt did not answer the question. As he talked
on, his smooth, handsome, boyish face assumed the aspect of
a quarrelsome old man’s. Yet his voice remained gentle and
slow, and his bearing phlegmatic. “Humanity to-day has
lost its faith,” he continued. “Faith has leaked out like
water from a cracked glass. Our age is tyrannised by machinery:
it is a mob rule without parallel. Who will save us
from machinery and from business? The golden calf has
gone mad. The spirit of man kowtows to a warehouse. Our
watchword is to be up and doing. We manufacture Christianity,
a renaissance, culture, et cetera. If it’s not quite the
real thing, yet it will serve. Everything tends toward the
external&mdash;toward expression, line, arabesque, gesture, mask.
Everything is stuck on a hoarding and lit by electric lamps.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Everything is the very latest, until something still later begins
to function. Thus the soul flees, goodness ceases, the
form breaks, and reverence dies. Do you feel no horror at
the generation that is growing up? The air is like that before
the flood.”</p>

<p>“Create, O artist, and don’t philosophize,” Imhof said
gently.</p>

<p>Weikhardt was shamed a little. “It’s true,” he said, “we
have no means of knowing the goal of it all. But there are
symptoms, typical cases that leave little room for hope. Did
you hear the story of the suicide of the German-American
Scharnitzer? He was pretty well known among artists. He
used to go to the studios himself, and buy whatever took his
fancy. He never bargained. Sometimes he would be accompanied
by a daughter of eighteen, a girl of angelic beauty.
Her name was Sybil, and he used to buy pictures for her.
She was especially fond of still-life and flower pieces. The
man had been in California and made millions in lumber.
Then he returned to the fatherland to give the girl an atmosphere
of calm and culture. Sybil was his one thought, his
hope, his idol and his world. He had been married but a
short time. His wife, it is said, ran away from him. All
that a life of feverish activity had left him of deep feeling
and of hope for the future was centred in this child. He
saw in her one girl in a thousand, a little saint. And so indeed
she seemed&mdash;extraordinarily dainty, proud and ethereal.
One would not have dared to touch her with one’s finger.
When the two were together, a delightful sense of harmony
radiated from them. The father, especially, seemed happy.
His voluntary death caused all the more consternation. No
one suspected the motive; it was assumed that he had suffered
a moment of madness. But he left behind him a letter
to an American friend which explained everything. He had
been indisposed one day, and had had to stay in bed. Sybil
had invited several girl friends to tea, and the little com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>pany
was in a room at the other end of their suite. But
all the doors between were open, even the last was slightly
ajar, so that the murmur of the girls’ voices came to him
inarticulately. A sudden curiosity seized him to know what
they were saying. He got up, slipped into a dressing gown,
went softly through the intervening rooms, and listened at
the door. The conversation was about the future of these
girls&mdash;the possibilities of love, happiness, and marriage. Each
gave her ideas. Finally it was Sybil’s turn to speak her
thoughts. At first she refused; but they urged her again
and again. She said she took no interest in emotions of any
sort; she didn’t yearn for love; she wasn’t able to feel even
gratitude to any one. What she expected of marriage was
simply liberation from a galling yoke. She wanted a man
who could give her all that life held&mdash;boundless luxury and
high social position&mdash;and who, moreover, would be abjectly
at her feet. That, she said, was her program, and she
intended to carry it out too. The other girls fell silent.
None answered. But that hour poisoned the father’s soul.
This cynicism, uttered by the pure and spiritual voice of
the child he adored and thought a miracle of depth and
sweetness, the child on whom he had wasted all he was and
had, plunged him into an incurable melancholy, and caused
him finally to end his life.”</p>

<p>“My dear fellow,” cried Imhof, and waved his arm, “that
man wasn’t a lumber merchant, he was a minor poet.”</p>

<p>“It’s possible that he was,” Weikhardt replied, and smiled;
“quite possible. What does it alter? I admire a man who
cannot survive the destruction of all his ideals. It’s better
than to be a cliff-breaker, I assure you. Most people haven’t
any ideals to be destroyed. They adapt themselves endlessly,
and become vulgar and sterile.” Again his eyes grew
sombre, and he added, half to himself: “Sometimes I dream
of one who neither rises nor falls, of one who walks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
earth whole and unchangeable, unswerving and unadaptable.
Perfectly unadaptable. It is of such an one that I
dream.”</p>

<p>Imhof jumped up, and smoothed his coat. “Talk, talk!”
he rattled, in the disagreeable military tone that he assumed
in his moments of pseudo-virility. “Talk won’t improve
things.” He passed his arm through Weikhardt’s, and as
they left the terrace, which had been gradually filling with
other guests, he recited, boldly, unashamed, and in the same
tone, the alcaic stanza of Hölderlin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse">“Still man will take up arms against all who breathe;</div>
       <div class="verse">Compelled by pride and dread he consumes himself in conflict, and destroys the lovely</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">Flower of his peace that is brief of blooming.”</div>
</div></div></div>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>On their first evening in Hamburg, Crammon rented a
box in the playhouse, and invited Christian, Johanna Schöntag,
and Herr Livholm, one of the directors of the Lloyd,
to be his guests. He had made the latter’s acquaintance in
the hotel where he had gone to pay Eva a visit of welcome.
He had liked the man, who cut a good figure, and so he had
added him to the party in order, as he put it, to keep the
atmosphere normal by the presence of an entirely neutral
person.</p>

<p>“Social skill,” he was accustomed to say, “is not unlike
skill in cookery and serving. Between two heavy, rich dishes
there must be one like foam that stimulates the palate quite
superficially. Otherwise the meal has no style.”</p>

<p>The play was a mediocre comedy, and Christian was frankly
bored. Crammon thought it his duty to show a condescending
and muffled amusement, and now and then he gave Christian
a gentle poke, to persuade him also to show some appreciation
of the performance. Johanna was the only one who
was genuinely amused. The source of her amusement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
an actor to whom a serious rôle had been assigned, but who
talked with such silly affectation and false importance that
every time he appeared she had to hold her lacy handkerchief
to her lips to smother her laughter.</p>

<p>Occasionally Christian gave the girl a far and estranged
glance. She wasn’t either agreeable or the reverse; he did
not know what to make of her. This feeling of his had not
changed since he had first seen her during the journey in
Eva’s company.</p>

<p>She felt the coldness of his glance. Her merriment did
not vanish; but on the lower part of her face appeared a
scarcely perceptible shadow of disappointment.</p>

<p>As though seeking for help, she turned to Christian. “The
man is terribly funny, don’t you think so?” It was characteristic
of her to end a question with a negative interrogation.</p>

<p>“He’s certainly worth seeing,” Christian agreed politely.</p>

<p>The door of the box opened, and Voss entered. He was
faultlessly dressed for the occasion; but no one had expected
or invited him. They looked at him in astonishment.
He bowed calmly and without embarrassment, stood
quite still, and gave his attention to the stage.</p>

<p>Crammon looked at Christian. The latter shrugged his
shoulders. After a while Crammon arose, and with sarcastic
courtesy pointed to his seat. Voss shook his head
in friendly refusal, but immediately thereafter assumed once
more his air of humility and abjectness. He stammered:
“I was in the stalls and looked up. I thought there was
no harm in paying a visit.” Suddenly Crammon went out,
and was heard quarrelling with the usher. Johanna had become
serious, and looked down at the audience. Christian,
as though to ward off disagreeable things, ducked his shoulders
a little. The people in the near-by seats became indignant
at the noise Crammon was making. Herr Livholm
felt that the proper atmosphere had hardly been preserved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Amadeus Voss alone showed himself insensitive to the situation.</p>

<p>He stood behind Johanna, and thought: “The hair of this
woman has a fragrance that turns one dizzy.” At the end
of the act he withdrew, and did not return.</p>

<p>Late at night, when he had him alone, Crammon vented
his rage on Christian. “I’ll shoot him down like a mad
dog, if he tries that sort of thing again! What does the
fellow think? I’m not accustomed to such manners. Damned
gallow’s bird&mdash;where’d he grow up? Oh, my prophetic soul!
I always distrusted people with spectacles. Why don’t you
tell him to go to hell? In the course of my sinful life, I’ve
come in contact with all kinds of people; I know the best
and I know the dregs; but this fellow is a new type. Quite
new, by God! I’ll have to take a bromide, or I won’t be able
to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I believe you are unjust, Bernard,” answered Christian,
with lowered eyes. But his face was stern, reserved, and
cold.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Amadeus Voss submitted the following plan to Christian:
to go to Berlin, first as an unmatriculated student, and
later to prepare himself for the state examination in medicine.</p>

<p>Christian nodded approvingly, and added that he intended
to go to Berlin shortly too. Voss walked up and down in
the room. Then he asked brusquely: “What am I to live
on? Am I to address envelopes? Or apply for stipends? If
you intend to withdraw your friendship and assistance, say
so frankly. I’ve learned to wade through the mud. The
new kind won’t offer more resistance than the old.”</p>

<p>Christian was thoroughly surprised. A week ago, in Holland,
he had given Amadeus ten thousand francs. “How
much will you need?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>“Board, lodging, clothes, books....” Voss went over
the items, and his expression was that of one who formulates
demands and uses the tone of request only as a matter of
courtesy. “I’ll be frugal.”</p>

<p>“I shall order two thousand marks a month to be sent
you,” Christian said, with an air of aversion. The impudent
demand for money pained him. Possession weighed upon
him like a mountain. He could not get his arms free nor
lift his chest, and the weight grew heavier and heavier.</p>

<p>In a bowl of chrysolite on the table lay a scarf-pin with
one large, black pearl. Voss, whose hands always groped
for some occupation, had taken it up, and held it between
his thumb and index finger against the light. “Do you
want the pin?” Christian asked. “Take it,” he persuaded
Amadeus, who was hesitating. “I really don’t care about
it.”</p>

<p>Voss approached the mirror, and with a curious smile
stuck the pin into his cravat.</p>

<p>When Christian was left alone, he stood for a while quite
lost in thought. Then he sat down, and wrote to his manager
at Christian’s Rest. He wrote in his lanky script and
his no less awkward style. “My dear Herr Borkowski:&mdash;I
have determined to sell Christian’s Rest, together with all
furnishings and objects of art, as well as the park, woods,
and farms. I herewith commission you to find a capable
and honest real estate dealer, who might telegraph me any
favourable offers. You know people of that sort, and need
merely drive over to Frankfort. Have the kindness to settle
the matter as quietly as possible. No advertisements are
to appear in the press.”</p>

<p>Then he wrote a second letter to the manager of his racing
stable at Waldleiningen. To write this he had to do
more violence to his heart than the first had cost him, for
he saw constantly fixed upon him the gentle or spirited eyes
of the noble animals. He wrote: “My dear Herr Schaller:&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
have determined to discontinue my racing stable. The
horses are to be sold at auction or quietly to fanciers. I
should prefer the latter method, and I suppose you share
that feeling. Baron Deidinger of Deidingshausen was at
one time much interested in Columbus and the mare Lovely.
Inquire of him whether he wants them. Admirable and
Bride o’ the Wind could be offered either to Prince Pless
or Herr von Strathmann. Have my friend Denis Lay’s Excelsior
sent to Baden-Baden, and boarded temporarily in the
stables of Count Treuberg. I don’t wish him to remain at
Waldleiningen alone.”</p>

<p>When he had sealed the letters, he sighed with relief.
He rang, and gave the letters to his valet. The latter had
turned to go, when Christian called him back. “I’m very
sorry to have to give you notice, Wilhelm,” he said. “I’m
going to attend to myself hereafter.”</p>

<p>The man could not trust his ears. He had been with
Christian for three years, and was genuinely devoted to him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but it’s necessary,” said Christian, looked past
the man, and had almost the same strange smile with which
he had watched Amadeus Voss at the mirror putting the
black pearl pin into his cravat.</p>


<h3>IX</h3>

<p>Crammon asserted that Amadeus Voss was paying his attentions
to Johanna Schöntag. Johanna was annoyed, and
tapped him with her long gloves. “I congratulate you on
your conquest, Rumpelstilzkin,” Crammon teased her. “To
have a monster like that in leash is no small achievement.
I should advise muzzling the monster, however. What do
you think, Christian, wouldn’t you advise a muzzle,
too?”</p>

<p>“A muzzle?” answered Christian. “Yes, if it would keep
people from talking. So many talk too much.”</p>

<p>Crammon bit his lips. The reproof struck him as harsh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
Somewhere beneath the downs of life on which he lay and
enjoyed himself, there was, evidently, a stone. The stone
hurt. He sought for it, but the softness of the down calmed
him again, and he forgot his pain.</p>

<p>“I was sitting in the breakfast room, and waiting for Madame
Sorel,” Johanna began in a voice whose every shading
and inflection sought to woo Christian’s ear, “when Herr
Voss came in and marched straight up to me. ‘What does
that bad man want of me?’ I asked myself. He asked me,
as though we’d been bosom friends for years, whether I didn’t
want to go with him to St. Paul’s to hear the famous itinerant
preacher Jacobsen. I couldn’t help laughing, and he stalked
away insulted. But this afternoon, as I was leaving the hotel,
he seemed suddenly to spring from the earth, and invited
me to a trip around the harbour. He had rented a motor
launch, and was looking for a companion. He had the same
gruff familiarity, and when he left he was quite as insulted
as before. And you call that paying attentions? I felt much
more as though he were going to drag me off and murder
me. But perhaps that’s only his manner.” She laughed.</p>

<p>“You’re the only person, at all events, whom he distinguishes
by observing at all,” Crammon said, with the same
mockery.</p>

<p>“Or the only one whom he considers his equal,” Johanna
said, with a childlike frown.</p>

<p>Christian was wondering: “Why does she laugh so often?
Why are her hands so pudgy and so very pink?” Johanna
felt his disapproval, and was as though paralysed. And yet
Christian felt himself drawn toward her by some hidden
power.</p>

<p>Why should he resist? Why be so ceremonious? Such was
his thought, as Johanna arose, and he, with unobtrusive glances,
observed her graceful form that still possessed the flexibility
of immaturity. He saw the nape of her slender neck, in which
were expressed both the weakness of her will and the fineness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of her temper. He knew these signs; he had often been guided
by them and used them.</p>

<p>Crammon, massive and magnificent in a great easy chair,
spoke with some emphasis of Eva’s appearance on the morrow.
The whole city was in a state of expectancy. But Christian
and Johanna had suddenly become truly aware of one another.</p>

<p>“Are you coming along?” Christian turned carelessly, and
with a sense of boredom, to Crammon.</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy, let us eat!” Crammon cried. He called
Hamburg the Paradise of Saint Bernard, concerning whom, as
his patron saint and namesake, he had instituted especial
investigations, and who, according to him, had been a mighty
trencherman during his lifetime at Tours.</p>

<p>A frightened, subtle, and very feminine smile hovered about
Johanna’s lips. As she preceded the two men, the motions of
her dainty body expressed a vague oppression of the spirit, and
at the same time a humorous rebellion against her own unfreedom.</p>


<h3>X</h3>

<p>Amadeus Voss knew that he had no one’s sympathy, no one’s
except Christian’s. And him he suspected, watching him,
weighing and analysing his words and actions. In his terror
of hypocrisy and treachery, he practised both himself. Nothing
healed or convinced or reconciled him. Least of all did
he pardon Christian the fact that the latter’s glance and
presence had the effect of subduing him. His bitterness
moaned from his very dreams.</p>

<p>He read in the Scriptures: “There was a certain house-holder,
which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about,
and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out
to husbandmen, and went into a far country: and when the
time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the
husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it. And
the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants,
more than the first, and they did unto them likewise. But last
of all, he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence
my son. But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said
among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and
let us seize on his inheritance. And they caught him, and
cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.”</p>

<p>Sometimes he would not leave Christian’s side for hours.
He would study his gestures and the expressions of his countenance,
and all these perceptions fed the corrosive fire in his
brain. For this was the heir! Then he would flee and bruise
and stamp upon his very soul, until his consciousness of guilt
cast him down into the very dust. He would return, and his
demeanour would be a silent confession: “I can thrive only in
your presence.” It seemed to him that this silence of his was
like a cry; but it was not heard, and so his brother seemed
again to become his foe. Thus he kept passing from
darkness, through fires and fumes, back into the darkness.</p>

<p>He suffered from his own embarrassment and importunateness.
In the midst of luxury and plenty, into which he had
been transferred by a fabulous turn of fortune, he suffered from
the memories of his former poverty, still felt how it had bound
and throttled him, and still rebelled against what was gone.
He could not freely take what was given him, but closed his
eyes, and shuddered with both desire and a pang of conscience.
He would not look upon the pattern of his web of life. He
turned its texture around, and brooded over the significance
of the intricately knotted threads. And there was no human
relationship which did not rouse his suspicion, no harmless
conversation in which he did not seek a sting directed toward
himself, no face that did not feed his hatred, no beauty whose
counter part of ugliness he did not see. To him everything
turned to poison and decay, all blossoms became noxious weeds,
all velvet a Nessus shirt, all light an evil smouldering, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
stimulus a wound: on every wall he saw the flaming letters,
<i>mene tekel upharsim</i>.</p>

<p>He could not yield himself or conquer the stubbornness of
his heart. With the object of his desire in his very hands,
his envy burned on. Whatever had once humiliated him
spurred his vengefulness through retrospection. Chastisements
which his father had inflicted distorted the old man’s image
beyond the grave; his fellow pupils in the seminary had once
strewn pepper into his coffee, and he could not forget it; he
could not forget the expression on the face of Adeline Ribbeck
with which she had given him his first month’s salary in a
closed envelope; he remembered the contempt and contumely
of hundreds, who had inflicted upon him their revenge for the
oppression or degradation which they themselves had endured.
He could not conquer these things nor forgive fate. The marks
that had been burned into his flesh throbbed like new wounds.</p>

<p>But at other times he would cast himself into the dust in
prayer and in great need of forgiveness. Religious scruples
plagued him into remorse; he panted for an hour’s release from
consciousness, judged himself with cruel severity, and condemned
himself to ascetic practices.</p>

<p>And these hurled him into the other extreme of a wild,
undiscriminating, and senseless dissipation and a mad waste
of money. He could no longer resist the excitement of gambling,
and fell into the hands of sharpers, drifted into loathsome
dives, where he acted the part of a wealthy man and an
aristocrat in incognito, for he desired to test this human mask
and prove its worthlessness to himself. Since his companions
took him seriously in this rôle, which filled his own mind with
shame and despair, he took his high losses with apparent calm,
and overlooked the open cheating. One evening the den in
which he happened to be was raided by the police, and he
escaped by a hair’s breadth. One creature clung to him, frightened
him with possible dangers ahead, threatened exposure,
and wrung from him a considerable sum of hush money.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>He became the prey of cocottes. He bought them jewels and
frocks and instituted nightly revels. In his eyes they were outcasts
that he used as a famishing man might slake his thirst
at a mud puddle with no clean water within reach. And he
was brutally frank with them. He paid them to endure his
contempt. They were surprised, resisted only his most infamous
abuses, and laughed at his unconquerable traits of the
churchly hypocrite. Once he remained alone with a girl who
was young and pretty. He had blindfolded himself. But
suddenly he fled as though the furies were at his heels.</p>

<p>Thrice he had set the date for his departure and as many
times had put it off. The image of Johanna had joined that of
Eva in his soul, and both raged in his brain. Both belonged to
an unattainable world. Yet Johanna seemed less alien; she
might conceivably hear his plea. Eva and her beauty were like
a strident jeer at all he was. He had heard so much and read
so much of her art that he determined to await her appearance,
in order (as he told Christian) to form a judgment of his
own, and be no longer at the mercy of those who fed her on
mere adulation and brazen flattery.</p>

<p>The audience was in full evening dress. Amadeus sat next
to Christian in the magnificent and radiant hall, in which had
gathered royal and princely persons, the senators of the free
city, the heads of the official and financial world, and representatives
of every valley and city of Germany. Christian
had bought seats near the stage. Crammon, who was an expert
in matters of artistic perspective, had preferred the first
row in the balcony. With him were Johanna and Botho von
Thüngen, to whom he had emphatically explained that the play
of the dancer’s feet and legs was interfered with by the dark
line of the stage below, while from their present position its
full harmony would be visible.</p>

<p>Amadeus Voss had almost determined to remain rigid in
mind. He hardly resisted actively, for he did not expect
anything powerful enough to make resistance worth while.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
He was cold, dull, unseeing. Suddenly there floated upon the
stage a bird-like vision, a being miraculously eased of human
heaviness, one who was all rhythm, and turned the rhythm
of motion into music. She broke the chains of the soul, and
made every emotion an image, every action a myth, every step
a conquest over space and matter. But the face of Amadeus
seemed to say: How can that serve me? How does that serve
you? Filled by the fury of sex, he saw only a scabrous exhibition,
and when the thunder of applause burst out, he
showed his teeth.</p>

<p>Eva’s last number was a little dramatic episode, a charming
<i>jeu d’esprit</i>, which she had invented and worked out, to be
accompanied by a composition of Delibes. It was very simple.
She was Pierrot playing with a top. She regulated and guided
the whimsical course of the toy. In ever new positions, turns,
and rhythms, she finally drove the top toward a hole into
which it disappeared. But this trivial action was so filled with
life by the wealth and variety of her rhythmic gestures, so
radiant with spirit and swiftest grace, so fresh in inspiration,
so heightened in the perfection of its art, that the audience
watched breathlessly, and released its own tensity in a fury of
applause.</p>

<p>In the foyer Crammon rushed up to Christian, and drew
him through the crowd along the dim passage way that led back
of the stage. Amadeus Voss, unnoticed by Crammon, followed
them unthinkingly and morosely. The sight of the wings,
of cliffs and trees, of discarded drops, electrical apparatus and
pulleys and of the hurrying stage-hands, stirred in him a dull
and hostile curiosity.</p>

<p>An excited crowd thronged toward Eva’s dressing-room. She
sat in the silken Pierrot costume of black and white, the dainty
silver whip still in her hand, amid a forest of flowers. Before
her kneeled Johanna Schöntag with an adoring moisture in her
eyes. Susan gave her mistress a glass of cool champagne.
Then in a mixture of five or six languages she tried to make it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
clear to the unbidden guests that they were in the way. But
each wanted a look, a word, a smile of Eva for himself.</p>

<p>Next to the room in which Eva sat, and separated from it by
a thin partition with an open door, was a second dressing-room,
which contained only her costumes and a tall mirror. Accidentally
pushed in that direction, and not through any will of
his own, Amadeus Voss suddenly found himself alone in this
little chamber. Having entered it, his courage grew, and he
ventured a little farther in.</p>

<p>He looked around and stared at the garments that lay and
hung here&mdash;the shimmering silks, the red, green, blue, white,
and yellow shawls and veils, the fragrant webs of gauze, batiste,
and tulle. There were wholly transparent textures and the
heaviest brocades. One frock glowed like pure gold, another
gleamed like silver; one seemed made of rose-leaves, another
knitted of spun glass, one of white foam and one of amethyst.
And there stood dainty shoes&mdash;a long row of them, shoes of
Morocco leather and of kid and silk; and there were hose of
all colours, and laces and ribands and antique beads and
brooches. The air was drenched with a fragrance that stung
his senses&mdash;a fragrance of precious creams and unguents, of a
woman’s skin and hair. His pulses throbbed and his face
turned grey. Involuntarily he stretched out his hand, and
grasped a painted Spanish shawl. Angrily, greedily, beside
himself, he crushed it in his hands, and buried his mouth and
nose in it and trembled in every limb.</p>

<p>At that moment Susan Rappard saw him, and pointed to him
with a gesture of astonishment. Eva saw him too, gently
thrust Johanna aside, arose, and approached the threshold.
When she saw the man in his strange and absorbed ecstasy, she
felt as though she had been spattered with filth, and uttered
a soft, brief cry. Amadeus Voss twitched and dropped the
shawl. His eyes were wild and guilty. With a light laugh and
an expression of transcendent contempt, which summed up a
long dislike, Eva raised the little silver whip and struck him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
full in the face. His features grew very white, in a contortion
of voluptuousness and terror.</p>

<p>In the tense silence Christian went up to Eva, took the silver
whip from her hand, and said in a tone scarcely distinguishable
from his habitual one: “Oh, no, Eva, I shall not let you do
that.” He held the handle of the whip firmly at both ends,
and bent it until the fragile metal snapped. Then he threw
the two pieces on the floor.</p>

<p>They gazed at each other. Disgust at Amadeus still flamed
in Eva’s face. It yielded to her astonishment at Christian’s
temerity. But Christian thought: “How beautiful she is!”
And he loved her. He loved her in her black and white Pierrot’s
costume with the black velvet buttons, he loved her with that
little cap and its impudent little tassel on her head; he loved
her, and she seemed incomparable to him, and his blood cried
out after her as in those nights from which she had driven him
forth. But he also asked himself: “Why has she grown evil?”
And a strange compassion for her stole over him, and a stranger
sense of liberation. And he smiled. But to all who were
watching, this smile of his seemed a little empty.</p>

<p>Again Amadeus Voss read in the Scripture: “What mean ye
that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the
poor? Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk
with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and
mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:
Therefore the Lord will strike with a scab the crown of the
head of the daughters of Zion, and the Lord will discover their
secret parts. In that day will the Lord take away the bravery
of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls,
and their round tires like the moon, the chains, and the
bracelets, and the mufflers, the bonnets, and the ornaments of
the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,
the rings, and nose jewels, the changeable suits of apparel, and
the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, the
glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods and the veils. And it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be
stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set
hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sack-cloth;
and burning instead of beauty. Thy men shall fall by
the sword, and thy mighty in the war. And her gates shall
lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the
ground.”</p>

<p>On the same evening he left for Berlin.</p>


<h3>XI</h3>

<p>Lorm and Judith had a magnificent apartment near the
Tiergarten in Berlin.</p>

<p>Edgar Lorm flourished. Order and regularity ruled his life.
With childlike boastfulness he spoke of his home. His manager
and friend, Dr. Emanuel Herbst, congratulated him on his
visible rejuvenation.</p>

<p>He introduced to Judith the people whom he had long
valued; but she judged most of them sharply and without
sympathy. Her characteristic arrogance drove away many
who meant well. But under the sway of his new comforts
Lorm submitted to her opinions.</p>

<p>But he would not give up Emanuel Herbst. When Judith
mocked at his waddling gait, his homeliness, his piping voice,
his tactless jokes, Lorm grew serious. “I’ve known him for
over twenty years. The things that annoy you endear him to
me quite as much as those precious qualities in him which I
know well, and which you’ve had no chance to discover.”</p>

<p>“No doubt he’s a monster of virtue,” Judith replied, “but
he bores me to extinction.”</p>

<p>Lorm said: “One should get used to the idea that other
people don’t exist exclusively for our pleasure. Your point of
view is too narrowly that of use and luxury. There are human
qualities that I value more highly than a handsome face or
polished manners. One of these is trustworthiness. People
with whom one has professional dealings often refuse to honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the demands of common decency&mdash;especially in regard to the
keeping of their given word&mdash;with a calm frivolity that makes
one’s gorge rise. So I’m intensely grateful to Herbst, since it
means so infinitely much to me, for this&mdash;that our relations
have never been shadowed by distrust, and that our simplest
verbal agreements are as firm and as valid as a written contract.”</p>

<p>Judith recognized that in this case she would have to change
her tactics. She was amiable, as though she were convinced
of his virtues, and sought to gain his favour. Dr. Herbst saw
through her, but showed no consciousness of his insight. He
treated her with an elaborate courtesy that seemed a trifle old-fashioned,
and effectually concealed his reservations.</p>

<p>Sometimes in the evening she would sit with the two men,
and join in their shop talk of playwrights and plays, actors and
actresses, successes and failures. And while she seemed attentive,
and even asked an occasional question, she thought of
her dressmaker, of her cook, of her weekly account, or of her
old life, that was so different and had perished so utterly.
And her eyes would grow hard.</p>

<p>It would happen that she would pass through the rooms
with a bitter expression on her face and a hostile glance for
the things about her. She hated the many mirrors which Lorm
required, the rugs that had been recently bought, the pretentious
furniture and paintings, the countless bibelots, photographs,
ornaments, books, and piously guarded souvenirs.</p>

<p>She had never before lived in a house where other tenants
above and below reminded her of their repulsive and unfamiliar
lives. She listened to the slightest noises, and felt that she had
fallen into a slum.</p>

<p>It was hardly in harmony with her nature to wait each
morning until her husband happened to rise, to see that the
breakfast was complete, to stand aside while the barber, the
masseur, the chauffeur, the messenger of the theatre, and the
secretary had completed their tasks or received their instruc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>tions;
to wait again until he returned from rehearsal, tired,
annoyed, and hungry, and then to watch him at luncheon&mdash;a
meal that he required to be both rich and exquisite&mdash;gobble his
food; to guard him from noise and interruption when he memorized
his lines; to answer strange voices on the telephone, to
give information, refuse invitations, to send the troublesome
away and to soothe the impatient. She was wholly out of her
natural element, but she forced herself to endure even as
she had endured bodily pain when the long needle had been
thrust through her arm.</p>

<p>Emanuel Herbst, who was a keen observer and a learned
student of human nature, quietly analysed the relations of this
husband and this wife. He said to himself: “Lorm is not fulfilling
her expectations; so much is clear. She fancied she
could peel him the way one peels an onion, and that the removal
of each layer would reveal something so new and surprising as
to make up to her for all she has renounced. She will soon
discover her miscalculation, for Lorm is always the same. He
can’t be stripped. He wears his costumes and puts on make-up.
She will soon reproach him for this very ability to fill empty
forms with a beautiful content, and to remain, in his own
person, but a humble servitor of his art. And the more guilty
he becomes in her eyes, the more power over him will she gain.
For he is tired&mdash;tired to death of the affected, the flatterers and
sentimentalists, of the sweets and easements of his daily life.
Terribly spoiled as he is, he yearns unconsciously for chains and
a keeper.”</p>

<p>The result of his reflection filled Emanuel Herbst with
anxious apprehension.</p>

<p>But Judith remembered her dream&mdash;how she had lain beside
a fish because it pleased her, and then beaten it in sudden rage
over its cool, moist, slippery, opalescent scales. And she lay
beside the fish and struck it, and the fish became more and
more subservient and her own.</p>

<p>Her constant terror was this thought: “I am poor, impover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>ished,
dependent, without security.” The thought tormented
her to such a degree that she once expressed it to the housekeeper.
The latter was astonished and replied: “But in addition
to your pin money, the master gives you two thousand
marks a month for the house. Why should you yield to morbid
fancies?”</p>

<p>Judith looked at the woman suspiciously. She distrusted all
whom she paid. The moment they mentioned money she
fancied herself robbed.</p>

<p>One day the cook gave notice. She was the fourth since the
establishment of the household. A quantity of sugar was missing.
There was a quarrel, an ugly one, and Judith was told
things that no one had ever dared to tell her before.</p>

<p>The secretary mislaid a key. When at last it was found
Judith rushed to the drawer which it fitted to see whether the
stationery, the pencils, and the pen-points were intact.</p>

<p>The housekeeper had bought twenty yards of linen. Judith
thought the price paid too high. She drove to the shop herself.
The taxi-fare amounted to more than she could possibly
have saved on the purchase. Then she chaffered with
the clerk for a reduction, until it was granted her through sheer
weariness. She told Lorm the story with a triumphant air. He
neglected to praise her. She jumped up from the table, locked
herself in her room, and went to bed. Whenever she thought
that she had some reason for anger, she went to bed.</p>

<p>Lorm came to her door, knocked softly, and asked her to
open it. She let him stand long enough to regret his conduct,
and then opened the door. She told her story all over, and he
listened with a charming curiosity on his face. “You’re a
jewel,” he said, and stroked her cheek and hand.</p>

<p>But it would also happen, if she really wanted something,
that she would spend sums out of all proportion to her wretched
little economies. She would see a hat, a frock, an ornament in
a show window, and not be able to tear herself away. Then she
would go into the shop, and pay the price asked at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>One day she visited an auction sale, and happened to come
in just as an old Viennese bon-bon dish was offered for sale.
It was one of those objects that make little show, but which
delight the collector’s heart. At first the dish didn’t tempt her
at all. Then the high bidding for it excited her, and she herself
began to bid for it. It kindled something in her, and she
made bid after bid, and drove all competitors from the field.</p>

<p>Hot and excited, she came home and rushed into Lorm’s
study. Emanuel Herbst was with him. The two men sat
by the fire in familiar talk. Judith disregarded Herbst. She
stood before her husband, unwrapped the dish, and said: “Look
at this exquisite thing I bought, Edgar.”</p>

<p>It was toward evening, but no lights had been lit. Lorm
loved the twilight and the flicker of the fire in his chimney,
which was, alas, only a metropolitan imitation of a log fire.
In the rich, red, wavering reflection of the glow, Judith looked
charming in her delight and mobility.</p>

<p>Lorm took the dish, regarded it with polite interest, drew up
his lips a little, and said: “It’s pretty.” Herbst’s face puckered
into innumerable ironical little wrinkles.</p>

<p>Judith grew angry. “Pretty? Don’t you see that it’s magical,
a perfect little dream, the sweetest and rarest thing imaginable?
The connoisseurs were wild after it! Do you know
what it cost? Eighteen hundred marks. And I had six or
seven rabid competitors bidding against me. Pretty!” She
gave a hard little laugh. “Give it to me. You handle it too
clumsily.”</p>

<p>“Calm yourself, sweetheart,” said Lorm gently. “I suppose
its virtues are subtle.”</p>

<p>But Judith was hurt, more by Herbst’s silent mockery than
by Lorm’s lack of appreciation. She threw back her head,
rustled through the room, and slammed the door behind her.
When she was angry, her own manners had, at times, a touch
of commonness.</p>

<p>For a while the two men were silent. Then Lorm, embar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>rassed
and with a deprecating smile, said: “A little dream
... for eighteen hundred marks.... Oh, well! There’s
something childlike about her.”</p>

<p>Emanuel Herbst rubbed his tongue up and down between his
teeth and his upper lip. It made him look like an ancient baby.
Then he ventured: “You ought to make it clear to her that
eighteen hundred marks are one thousand eight hundred times
one mark.”</p>

<p>“She won’t get that far,” answered Lorm. “Somebody who
has always lived on the open sea, and is suddenly transported
to a little inland lake, finds it hard to get the new measurements
and perspectives. But women are queer creatures.” He
sighed and smiled. “Have a nip of whiskey, old man?”</p>

<p>Sorrowfully Herbst rocked his Cæsarean head. “Why
queer? They are as they are, and one must treat them accordingly.
Only one mustn’t be under any mistaken impression
as to what one has. For instance: A horseshoe is not birch
wood. It looks like a bow, but you can’t bend it&mdash;not with all
your might. If you string it, the string droops slackly and will
never propel your arrow. All right, let’s have your whiskey.”</p>

<p>“But occasionally,” Lorm replied cheerfully, and filled the
tiny glasses, “you can turn a horseshoe into the finest
Damascene steel.”</p>

<p>“Bravo! A good retort! You’re as ready as Cardinal
Richelieu. Your health!”</p>

<p>“If you’ll let me be Richelieu, I’ll appoint you to be my
Father Joseph. A great rôle, by the way. Your health, old
man!”</p>


<h3>XII</h3>

<p>Crammon and Johanna Schöntag planned to drive to Stellingen
to see Hagenbeck’s famous zoological gardens, and Crammon
begged Christian to lend them his car. They were just
about to start when Christian issued from the hotel. “Why
don’t you come along?” Crammon asked. “Have you any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>thing
better to do? The three of us can have a very amusing
time.”</p>

<p>Christian was about to refuse, when he caught Johanna’s
urgent and beseeching look. She had the art of putting her
wishes into her eyes in such a way that one was drawn by them
and lost the power to resist. So he said: “Very well, I’ll come
along,” and took the seat next to Johanna’s. But he was
silent on the whole drive.</p>

<p>It was a sunny day of October.</p>

<p>They wandered through the park, and Johanna made droll
comments on the animals. She stopped in front of a seal,
and exclaimed: “He looks quite like Herr Livholm, don’t you
think so?” She talked to a bear as though he were a simple
sort of man, and fed him bits of sugar. She said that the
camels were incredible, and only pretended to look that way to
live up to the descriptions in the books of natural history.
“They’re almost as ugly as I am,” she added; and then, with
a crooked smile: “Only more useful. At least I was told at
school that their stomachs are reservoirs of water. Isn’t the
world a queer place?”</p>

<p>Christian wondered why she spoke so contemptuously of
herself. She bent over a stone balustrade, and the sight of her
neck somehow touched him. She seemed to him a vessel of
poor and hurt things.</p>

<p>Crammon discoursed. “It is very curious about animals.
Scientists declare they have a great deal of instinct. But what
is instinct? I’ve usually found them to be of an unlimited
stupidity. On the estate where I passed my childhood, we
had a horse, a fat, timid, gentle horse. It had but one vice:
it was very ticklish. I and my playmates were strictly enjoined
from tickling it. Naturally we were constantly tempted
to tickle it. There were five of us little fellows&mdash;no higher
than table legs. Each procured a little felt hat with a cock’s
feather in it. And as the horse stood dull-eyed in front of the
stable, we marched in single file under the belly of the stupid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
beast, tickling it with our feathers as we passed. The feathers
tickled so frightfully that he kicked with all fours like a mule.
It’s a riddle to me to this day how one of us, at least, failed to
be killed. But it was amusing and grotesque, and there was no
sign of instinct anywhere.”</p>

<p>They went to the monkey house. A crowd stood about a
little platform, on which a dainty little monkey was showing
off its tricks under the guidance of a trainer. “I have a horror
of monkeys,” said Crammon. “They annoy me through memory.
Science bids me feel a relationship with them; but after
all one has one’s pride. No, I don’t acknowledge this devilish
atavism.” He turned around, and left the building in order to
wait outside.</p>

<p>Alone with Christian, a wave of courage conquered Johanna’s
timidity. She took Christian’s arm and drew him nearer to
the platform. She was utterly charmed, and her delight was
childlike. “How dear, how sweet, how humble!” she cried.
A spiritual warmth came from her to Christian. He yielded
himself to it, for he needed it. Her boyish voice, however,
stirred his senses and aroused his fear. She stood very close
by him; he felt her quiver, the response to the hidden erotic
power that was in him, and the other voices of his soul were
silenced.</p>

<p>He took her hand into his. She did not struggle, but a painful
tension showed in her face.</p>

<p>Suddenly the little monkey stopped in its droll performance
and turned its lightless little eyes in terror toward the spectators.
Some shy perception had frightened it; it seemed,
somehow, to think and to recollect itself. As it became aware of
the many faces, the indistinctness of its vision seemed to take
on outline and form. Perhaps for a second it had a sight of the
world and of men, and that sight was to it a source of boundless
horror. It trembled as in a fever; it uttered a piercing cry
of lamentation; it fled, and when the trainer tried to grasp it,
it leaped from the platform and frantically sought a hiding-place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Tears glittered in its eyes and its teeth chattered, and
in spite of the animal characteristics of these gestures and
expressions, there was in them something so human and soulful
that only a few very coarse people ventured to laugh.</p>

<p>To Christian there came from the little beast a breath from
an alien region of earth and forests and loneliness. His heart
seemed to expand and then to contract. “Let us go,” he said,
and his own voice sounded unpleasantly in his ears.</p>

<p>Johanna listened to his words. She was all willingness to
listen, all tension and all sweet humility.</p>


<h3>XIII</h3>

<p>Randolph von Stettner had arrived. There were still several
days before the date of his sailing, and he was on his way to
Lübeck, where he wished to say good-bye to a married sister.
Christian hesitated to promise to be in Hamburg on his
friend’s return. Only after much urging did he consent to
stay.</p>

<p>They dined in Christian’s room, discussed conditions in their
native province, and exchanged reminiscences. Christian,
laconic as usual, was silently amazed at the distance of all
these things from his present self.</p>

<p>When the waiter had removed the dishes, Stettner gave an
account of all that had driven him to the determination to
expatriate himself. While he talked he stared with an unchanging
look and expression at the table cover.</p>

<p>“You know that for some years I’ve not been comfortable in
my uniform. I saw no aim ahead except the slow and distant
moments of advancement. Some of my comrades hoped for
war. Well, the life makes that hope natural. In war one can
prove one’s self in the only way that has any meaning to a professional
soldier in any army. But personally I couldn’t share
that hope. Others marry money, still others go in for sports
and gambling. None of these things attracted me. The service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
itself left me utterly dissatisfied. I seemed to myself in reality
an idler who lives pretentiously on others.</p>

<p>“Imagine this: you stand in the barracks yard; it’s raining,
the water makes the sand gleam; the few wretched trees drip
and drip; the men await some command with the watchfulness
of well-trained dogs; the water pours from their packs, the
sergeant roars, the corporals grit their teeth in zeal and rage;
but you? With a monotony like that of the drops that trickle
from your cap, you think: ‘What will to-night be like? And
to-morrow morning? And to-morrow night?’ And the whole
year lies ahead of you like a soaked and muddy road. You
think of your desolate room with its three dozen books, the
meaningless pictures, and the carpet worn thin by many feet;
you think of the report you’ve got to hand in, and the canteen
accounts you’ve got to audit, and the stable inspection, and the
next regimental ball, where the arrogant wives of your superior
officers will bore you to the point of illness with their shallow
talk; you think your way through the whole circle of your
life, and find nothing but what is trivial and cheerless as a
rainy day. Is that endurable?</p>

<p>“One day I put the question to myself: What was I really
accomplishing, and what was the nature of my reward? The
answer was that, from a human and intellectual point of view,
my accomplishment was an absolute zero. My reward consisted
of a number of privileges, the sum of which raised me
very high in the social scale, but gave me this position only at
the cost of surrendering my personality wholly. I had to
obey my superiors and to command my inferiors. That was
all. The power to command was conditioned in the duty to
obey. And each man in the service, whatever his station, is
bound in the identical way, and is simply a connective apparatus
in a great electrical circuit. Only the humblest, the great
mass of privates, were confined to obedience. The ultimate
responsibility at the very top was lost in the vague. In spite
of its ultimate primitiveness, the structure of every military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
organization has a mystery at its core. But between the
arbitrary will of a very few and the touching and incomprehensible
humility of the great mass, the parts function according
to iron laws. Whoever refuses to function, or rebels, is
crushed.</p>

<p>“There are those who assert that this compulsion has a
moral effect and subserves a higher conception of freedom.
I was myself of that opinion for a long time; but I did not find
it permanently tenable. I felt myself weakening, and a rebellion
seething in my blood. I pulled myself together, and fought
against criticism and doubt. In vain. Something had gone
out of me. I lost the readiness to obey and the security to
command. It was torment. Above me I saw implacable idols,
below me defenceless victims. I myself was both idol and
victim, implacable and defenceless at once. It seemed to me
that humanity ceased where the circle of my activity began. My
life seemed to me no longer a part of the general life of mankind,
but a fossilized petrefaction conditioned in certain formulæ
of command and obedience.</p>

<p>“This condition could, of course, not remain hidden. My
comrades withdrew their confidence from me. I was observed
and distrusted. Before I had time to clarify either my mind
or my affairs, an incident occurred which forced me to a
decision. A fellow officer in my regiment, Captain von Otto,
was engaged to the daughter of an eminent judge. The wedding,
although the date had been set, could not take place.
Otto had a slight attack of pulmonary trouble and had to go
South for cure. About four weeks after his departure, there
was a celebration in honour of the emperor’s birthday, and
among the ladies invited was the captain’s betrothed. Everybody
was rather gay and giddy that evening, especially a dear
friend of mine, Georg Mattershausen, a sincere, kindly chap
who had just received a promotion in rank. The captain’s
betrothed, who had been his neighbour at table, was infected
by his merriment, and on the way home he begged her for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
kiss. She refused, and he was going to steal one. She now
grew very serious; he at once came to his senses, apologized
with the utmost sincerity, and, at the very door of her paternal
house, received her solemn promise to mention the incident
to no one. When, however, seventeen weeks later, Captain
von Otto returned, the girl was seized by some queer scruple,
and thought it her duty to tell him of the incident between herself
and Mattershausen. The result was a challenge. The
conditions were extraordinarily severe: ten paces distance,
drawn revolvers, half a minute to aim, exchange of shots to
the disablement of either combatant. I was Mattershausen’s
second. Otto, who had held himself to be affronted and had
sent the challenge, had the first shot. He aimed carefully at
the head of his adversary. I saw that. But the bullet whistled
past my friend’s ear. Mattershausen aimed, but his revolver
did not go off. This was counted a shot. New pistols were
brought. Otto aimed as carefully as before and this time shot
Mattershausen straight through the heart. Death was immediate.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether you, too, think that that was a harsh
punishment for a moment of youthful thoughtlessness and impropriety.
To me it seemed terribly harsh. I felt profoundly
that a crime had been committed against my friend. Our
fossilized caste had perpetrated a murder. Two days later,
in the officers’ mess, I expressed this opinion quite frankly.
There was general astonishment. One or two sharp replies were
made. Some one asked me what I would have done in such
a situation. I answered that I would certainly not have sent
a challenge, that I could never approve a notion of honour so
morbid and self-centred as to demand a human life for a
trifle. Even if the young girl’s over-tender conscience had persuaded
her to break her promise, I would have caused no
further trouble, and let the little incident glide into forgetfulness.
At that there was general indignation&mdash;a great shaking
of heads, angry or troubled faces, an exchange of significant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
glances. But I kept on. Mattershausen’s wretched end had
hit me damned hard, and I relieved my whole mind. So I
added that, if I had been in Mattershausen’s place, I would
have refused the challenge, quite regardless of consequences.
That statement fell among them like a bomb, and a painful
silence followed. ‘I imagine you would have reconsidered,’
said the ranking major, ‘I don’t think you would have disregarded
all the consequences.’ ‘All,’ I insisted, ‘certainly, all!’
At that moment Captain von Otto, who had been sitting at
another table, arose, and asked frostily: ‘You would have
risked the odium of cowardice?’ I too arose, and answered:
‘Under such circumstances I would have risked that too.’
Captain von Otto smiled a contorted smile, and said with an
emphasis that could not be misinterpreted: ‘Then I don’t
understand your sitting at the same table with officers of His
Majesty.’ He bowed stiffly, and went out.</p>

<p>“The die had been cast. No one was curious as to what
I would do; no one doubted but that there was only one thing
left for me to do. But I was determined to push the matter to
its logical conclusion. That super-idol, known as the code of
honour, had issued its decree; but I was determined to refuse
obedience and take the consequences upon myself. That very
evening, when I came home, two comrades were awaiting me
to offer me their services. I refused courteously. They looked
at me as though I had gone mad, and went off in absurd haste.</p>

<p>“The inevitable consequences followed. You can understand
that I could no longer breathe in that air. You cannot
outrage the fetishes of your social group and go unpunished.
I had to avoid insult, and learned what it was to be an outcast.
And that is bad. The imagination alone cannot quite grasp the
full horror of it. I saw clearly that there was no place left for
me in my fatherland. The way out was obvious.”</p>

<p>Christian had listened to his friend’s story with unmoved
countenance. He got up, took a few turns through the room,
and returned to his seat. Then he said: “I think you did the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
right thing. I am sorry you must leave us, but you did
right.”</p>

<p>Stettner looked up. How strange that sounded: You did
right. A question hovered on his lips. But it was not uttered.
For Christian feared that question, and silenced it by a sudden
conventionality of demeanour.</p>


<h3>XIV</h3>

<p>Christian, the brothers Maelbeek, who had followed Eva
from Holland, Botho von Thüngen, a Russian councillor of
state named Koch, and Crammon sat at luncheon in the dining
hall of the hotel.</p>

<p>They were talking about a woman of the streets who had
been murdered. The police had already caught the murderer.
He was a man who had once belonged to good society, but had
gradually gone to the dogs. He had throttled the woman and
robbed her in a sailor’s tavern.</p>

<p>Now all the prostitutes in the city had unanimously determined
to show their sister, who had sacrificed her life to her
calling, a last and very public mark of respect, and to follow her
coffin to the grave. The respectable citizens of Hamburg felt
this to be a sort of challenge and protested. But there was no
legal provision by which the demonstration could be stopped.</p>

<p>“We ought to see the spectacle,” said Crammon, “even if we
have to sacrifice our siesta.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s no time to be lost,” the elder Maelbeek declared,
and looked at his watch. “The friends will assemble
at the house of mourning at three sharp.” He smiled, and
thought this way of putting the matter rather witty.</p>

<p>Christian said that he would go too. The motor took them to
a crossing that had been closed by the police. Here they left
the car, and Herr von Thüngen persuaded the police captain to
let them pass.</p>

<p>They were at once surrounded by a great throng of humble
folk&mdash;sailors, fishermen, workingmen, women, and children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
The windows of the houses were thronged with heads. The
Maelbeeks and Koch stopped here, and called Thüngen to join
them. Christian walked farther. Somehow the behaviour of his
companions irritated him. He felt the kind of curiosity which
filled them as something disagreeable. He was curious too,
but in another way. Or, at least, it seemed different to him.</p>

<p>Crammon remained by his side. But the throng grew rowdy.
“Where are you going?” Crammon asked peevishly. “There
is no use in going farther. Let us wait here.”</p>

<p>Christian shook his head.</p>

<p>“Very well. I take my stand here,” Crammon decided, and
separated from Christian.</p>

<p>The latter made his way up to the dirty, old house at the
door of which the hearse was standing. It was a foggy day.
The black wagon was like a dark hole punched into the grey.
Christian wanted to go a little farther, but some young fellows
purposely blocked his way. They turned their heads, looked
him over, and suspected him of being a “toff.” Their own
garb was cheap and flashy; their faces and gestures made it
clear what trade they drove. One of them was a young giant.
He was half a head taller than Christian, and his brows joined
over the bridge of his nose. On the index finger of his left
hand he wore a huge carnelian ring.</p>

<p>Christian looked about him quite unintimidated. He saw
hundreds of women, literally hundreds, ranging in age from
sixteen to fifty, and in condition from bloom to utter decay, and
from luxury to rags and filth.</p>

<p>They had all gathered&mdash;those who had passed the zenith of
their troubled course, and those who had barely emerged from
childhood, frivolous, sanguine, vain, and already tainted with
the mire of the great city. They had come from all streets;
they were recruited from all nations and all classes; some had
escaped from a sheltered youth, others had risen from even
direr depths; there were those who felt themselves pariahs
and had the outcast’s hatred in their eyes, and there were others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
who showed a certain pride in their calling and held themselves
aloof. He saw cynical and careworn faces, lovely and hardened
ones, indifferent and troubled, greedy and gentle faces. Some
were painted and some pallid; and the latter seemed strangely
naked.</p>

<p>He was familiar with them from the streets and houses of
many cities, as every man is. He knew the type, the unfailing
stamp, the acquired gesture and look&mdash;this hard, rigid, dull,
clinging, lightless look. But he had never before seen them
except when they were exercising their function behind the
gates of their calling, dissembling their real selves and under
the curse of sex. To see many hundreds of them separated
from all that, to see them as human beings stripped of the
stimulus and breath of a turbid sexuality&mdash;that was what
seemed to sweep a cloud from his eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly he thought: “I must order my hunting lodge to be
sold, and the hounds too.”</p>

<p>The coffin was being carried from the house. It was covered
with flowers and wreaths; and from the wreaths fluttered ribands
with gilt inscriptions. Christian tried to read the inscriptions,
but it was impossible. The coffin had small, silver-plated
feet that looked like the paws of a cat. By some accident
one of these had been broken off, and that touched Christian,
he hardly knew why, as unbearably pitiful. An old
woman followed the coffin. She seemed more vexed and angry
than grief-stricken. She wore a black dress, but the seam under
one arm was ripped open. And that too seemed unbearably
pitiful.</p>

<p>The hearse started off. Six men carrying lighted candles
walked in front of it. The murmur of voices became silent. The
women, walking by fours, followed the hearse. Christian stood
still close pressed against a wall, and let the procession pass
him by. In a quarter of an hour the street was quite desolate.
The windows of the houses were closed. He remained alone in
the street, in the fog.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>As he walked away he reflected: “I’ve asked my father to
take care of my collection of rings. There are over four
thousand of them, and many are beautiful and costly. They
could be sold too. I don’t need them. I shall have them sold.”</p>

<p>He wandered on and on, and lost all sense of the passing of
time. Evening came, and the city lights glowed through the
fog. Everything became moist, even to the gloves on his hands.</p>

<p>He thought of the missing foot on the coffin of the murdered
harlot, and of the torn seam of the old woman’s dress.</p>

<p>He passed over one of the great bridges of the Elbe, and
then walked along the river bank. It was a desolate region.
He stopped near the light of a street lamp, gazed into the
water, drew forth his wallet, took out a bank note of a hundred
marks, turned it about in his hands, shook his head, and then,
with a gesture of disgust, threw it into the water. He took a
second and did the same. There were twenty bank notes in his
wallet. He took them out one by one, and with that expression
half of disgust, half of dreaminess, he let them glide into the
river.</p>

<p>The street lamps illuminated the inky water for a short
distance, and he saw the bank notes drift away.</p>

<p>And he smiled and went on.</p>


<h3>XV</h3>

<p>When he reached the hotel he felt an urgent need of warmth.
By turns he entered the library, the reception hall, the dining-room.
All these places were well heated, but their warmth did
not suffice him. He attributed his chill to walking so long
in the damp.</p>

<p>He took the lift and rode up to his own rooms. He changed
his clothes, wrapped himself warmly, and sat down beside the
radiator, in which the steam hissed like a caged animal.</p>

<p>Yet he did not grow warm. At last he knew that his
shivering was not due to the moisture and the fog, but to some
inner cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward eleven o’clock he arose and went out into the corridor.
The stuccoed walls were divided into great squares by
gilt moulding; the floor was covered by pieces of carpet that
had been joined together to appear continuous. Christian felt
a revulsion against all this false splendour. He approached the
wall, touched the stucco, and shrugged his shoulders in contempt.</p>

<p>At the end of the long corridor was Eva’s suite. He had
passed the door several times. As he passed it again he heard
the sound of a piano. Only a few keys were being gently
touched. After a moment’s reflection he knocked, opened the
door, and entered.</p>

<p>Susan Rappard was alone in the room. Wrapped in a fur
coat, she sat at the piano. On the music rack was propped
a book that she was reading. Her fingers passed with ghostly
swiftness over the keys, but she struck one only quite rarely.
She turned her head and asked rudely: “What do you want,
Monsieur?”</p>

<p>Christian answered: “If it’s possible, I should like to speak
to Madame. I want to ask her a question.”</p>

<p>“Now? At night?” Susan was amazed. “We’re tired.
We’re always tired at night in this hyperborean climate, where
the sun is a legend. The fog weighs on us. Thank God, in
four days we have our last performance. Then we’ll go where
the sky is blue. We’re longing for Paris.”</p>

<p>“I should be very happy if I could see Madame,” Christian
said.</p>

<p>Susan shook her head. “You have a strange kind of patience,”
she said maliciously. “I hadn’t suspected you of being
so romantic. You’re pursuing a very foolish policy, I assure
you. Go in, if you want to, however. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce petit laideron est chez
elle, demoiselle Schöntag.</span> She acts the part of a court fool.
Everything in the world is amusing to her&mdash;herself not least.
Well, that is coming to an end too.”</p>

<p>Voices and clear laughter could be heard. The door of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Eva’s rooms opened, and she and Johanna appeared on the
threshold. Eva wore a simple white garment, unadorned but
for one great chrysoprase that held it on the left shoulder.
Her skin had an amber gleam, the quiver of her nostrils betrayed
a secret irritation. The beautiful woman and the plain
one stood there side by side, each with an acute feminine consciousness
of her precise qualities: the one vital, alluring, pulsing
with distinction and freedom; the other all adoration and
yearning ambition for that vitality and that freedom.</p>

<p>Tenderly and delicately Johanna had put her arm about Eva
and touched her friend’s bare shoulder with her cheek. With
her bizarre smile she said: “No one knows how it came that
Rumpelstilzkin is my name.”</p>

<p>They had not yet observed Christian. A gesture of Susan’s
called their attention to him. He stood in the shadow of the
door. Johanna turned pale, and her shy glance passed from
Eva to Christian. She released Eva, bowed swiftly to kiss
Eva’s hand, and with a whispered good-night slipped past
Christian.</p>

<p>Although Christian’s eyes were cast down, they grasped the
vision of Eva wholly. He saw the feet that he had once held
naked in his hands; under her diaphanous garment he saw
the exquisite firmness of her little breasts; he saw the arms
that had once embraced him and the perfect hands that had
once caressed him. All his bodily being was still vibrantly
conscious of the smoothness and delicacy of their touch. And
he saw her before him, quite near and hopelessly unattainable,
and felt a last lure and an ultimate renunciation.</p>

<p>“Monsieur has a request,” said Susan Rappard mockingly,
and preparing to leave them.</p>

<p>“Stay!” Eva commanded, and the look she gave Christian
was like that she gave a lackey.</p>

<p>“I wanted to ask you,” Christian said softly, “what is the
meaning of the name Eidolon by which you used to call me.
My question is belated, I know, and it may seem foolish to-day.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
He smiled an embarrassed smile. “But it torments me
not to know when I think about it, and I determined to ask
you.”</p>

<p>Susan gave a soundless laugh. In its belated and unmotivated
urgency, the question did, indeed, sound a little foolish. Eva
seemed amused too, but she concealed the fact. She looked
at her hands and said: “It is hard to tell you what it means&mdash;something
that one sacrifices, or a god to whom one sacrifices,
a lovely and serene spirit. It means either or perhaps both at
once. Why remind ourselves of it? There is no Eidolon any
more. Eidolon was shattered, and one should not exhibit the
shards to me. Shards are ugly things.”</p>

<p>She shivered a little, and her eyes shone. She turned to
Susan. “Let me sleep to-morrow till I wake. I have such
evil dreams nowadays, and find no rest till toward morning.”</p>


<h3>XVI</h3>

<p>Passing back through the corridor Christian saw a figure
standing very still in the semi-darkness. He recognized
Johanna, and he felt that this thing was fated&mdash;that she should
be standing here and waiting for him.</p>

<p>She did not look at him; she looked at the floor. Not until
he came quite close to her did she raise her eyes, and then she
looked timidly away. Her lips quivered. A question hovered
on them. She knew all that had passed between Eva and
Christian. That they had once been lovers only increased her
enthusiastic admiration for them both. But what happened
between them now&mdash;her brief presence made her sure of its
character&mdash;seemed to her both shameful and incomprehensible.</p>

<p>She was imaginative and sensitive, and loved those who were
nobly proud; and she suffered when such noble pride and
dignity were humbled. Her whole heart was given over to her
ideal of spiritual distinction. Sometimes she would misunderstand
her own ideal, and take external forms and modes as
expressions of it. And this division in her soul, to which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
was not equal, sometimes delivered her into the power of mere
frivolity. “It is late,” she whispered timidly. It was not a
statement; it was an attempt to save herself. Each time that
Christian had been mentioned, three things had struck her
mind: his elegance, his fine pride, his power over all hearts.
That was the combination that called to her and stirred her and
filled her days with longing.</p>

<p>Thus she had followed Crammon in search of the great adventure,
although she had said of him but an hour after she had
met him: “He is grandiosely and grotesquely comic.” She had
followed him like a slave to a market of slaves, hoping to catch
the eye of the khalif.</p>

<p>But she had no faith in her own power. Voluntarily and
intentionally she crumbled the passions of her being into small
desires. She suffered from that very process and jeered at
herself. She was too timid to take greatly what she wanted.
She nibbled at life and had not the adventurousness of great
enjoyments. And she mocked at her own unhappy nature, and
suffered the more.</p>

<p>And now he stood before her. It frightened and surprised
her, even though she had waited for him. Since he stayed,
she wanted to think him bold and brave. But she could not,
and at once she shrank into self-contempt. “It is late,” she
whispered again, nodded a good-night, and opened the door of
her room.</p>

<p>But Christian begged silently with an expression that was
irresistible. He crossed the threshold behind the trembling
girl. Her face grew hard. But she was too fine to play a
coquettish game. Before her blood was stirred her eyes had
yielded. The pallor of her face lit it with a new charm. There
was no hint of plainness any more. The stormy expectation
of her heart harmonized the lines of her features and melted
them into softness, gentleness, and delicacy.</p>

<p>Of her power over the senses of men she was secure. She
had tested her magnetism on those whom one granted little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
and who gave less. Flirtations had been used as anodynes in
her social group. One had played with false counters, and by a
silent compact avoided serious moments. But her experience
failed her to-night, for here there was not lightness but austerity.
She yielded herself to this night, oblivious of the
future and its responsibilities.</p>


<h3>XVII</h3>

<p>Stephen Gunderam had to go to Montevideo. In that city
there was a German physician who had considerable skill in the
treatment of nervous disorders; and the bull-necked giant suffered
from insomnia and nocturnal hallucinations. Furthermore,
there was to be a yacht race at Montevideo, on the results
of which Stephen had bet heavily.</p>

<p>He appointed Demetrios and Esmeralda as Letitia’s guardians.
He said to them: “If anything happens to my wife or
she does anything unseemly, I’ll break every bone in your
bodies.” Demetrios grinned. Esmeralda demanded that he
bring her a box of sweets on his return.</p>

<p>Their leave-taking was touching. Stephen bit Letitia’s ear,
and said: “Be true to me.”</p>

<p>Letitia immediately began to play upon the mood of her
guardians. She gave Demetrios a hundred pesos and Esmeralda
a gold bracelet. She corresponded secretly with the naval
lieutenant, Friedrich Pestel. An Indian lad, of whose secrecy
and reliability she was sure, served as messenger. Within a
week Pestel’s ship was to proceed to Cape Town, so there was
little time to be lost. He did not think he would be able to
return to the Argentine until the following winter. And Letitia
loved him dearly.</p>

<p>Two miles from the estate there was an observatory in the
lonely pampas. A wealthy German cattle-man had built it,
and now a German professor with his two assistants lived there
and watched the firmament. Letitia had often asked to see the
observatory, but Stephen had always refused to let her visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
it. Now she intended to make it the scene of her meeting with
Friedrich Pestel. She yearned for a long talk with him.</p>

<p>To use an observatory as a refuge for forlorn lovers&mdash;it was
a notion that delighted Letitia and made her ready to run any
risk. The day and the hour were set, and all circumstances
were favourable. Riccardo and Paolo had gone hunting;
Demetrios had been sent by his father to a farm far to the
north; the old people slept. Esmeralda alone had to be deceived.
Fortunately the girl had a headache, and Letitia
persuaded her to go to bed. When twilight approached, Letitia
put on a bright, airy frock in which she could ride. She did
not hesitate in spite of her pregnancy. Then, as though taking
a harmless walk, she left the house and proceeded to the avenue
of palms, where the Indian boy awaited her with two ponies.</p>

<p>It was beautiful to ride out freely into the endless plain.
In the west there still shone a reddish glow, into which projected
in lacy outline the chain of mountains. The earth suffered
from drought; it had not rained for long, and crooked fissures
split the ground. Hundreds of grasshopper traps were
set up in the fields, and the pits behind them, which were from
two to three metres deep, were filled with the insects.</p>

<p>When she reached the observatory, it was dark. The building
was like an oriental house of prayer. From a low structure
of brick arose the mighty iron dome, the upper part of which
rotated on a movable axis. The shutters of the windows were
closed, and there was no light to be seen. Friedrich Pestel
waited at the gate; he had tethered his horse to a post. He
told her that the professor and his two assistants had been
absent for a week. She and he, he added, could enter the
building nevertheless. The caretaker, an old, fever-stricken
mulatto, had given him the key.</p>

<p>The Indian boy lit the lantern that he had carried tied to
his saddle. Pestel took it, and preceded Letitia through a
desolate brick hallway, then up a wooden and finally up a spiral
iron stairway. “Fortune is kind to us,” he said. “Next week<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
there’s going to be an eclipse of the sun, and astronomers are
arriving in Buenos Ayres from Europe. The professor and
his assistants have gone to receive them.”</p>

<p>Letitia’s heart beat very fast. In the high vault of the
observatory, the little light of the lantern made only the faintest
impression. The great telescope was a terrifying shadow;
the drawing instruments and the photographic apparatus on its
stand looked like the skeletons of animals; the charts on the
wall, with their strange dots and lines, reminded her of black
magic. The whole room seemed to her like the cave of a
wizard.</p>

<p>Yet there was a smile of childlike curiosity and satisfaction
on Letitia’s lips. Her famished imagination needed such an
hour as this. She forgot Stephen and his jealousy, the eternally
quarrelling brothers, the wicked old man, the shrewish Doña
Barbara, the treacherous Esmeralda, the house in which she
lived like a prisoner&mdash;she forgot all that completely in this
room with its magic implements, in this darkness lit only by the
dim flicker of the lantern, beside this charming young man who
would soon kiss her. At least, she hoped he would.</p>

<p>But Pestel was timid. He went up to the telescope, unscrewed
the gleaming brass cover, and said: “Let us take a
look at the stars.” He looked in. Then he asked Letitia to do
the same. Letitia saw a milky mist and flashing, leaping fires.
“Are those the stars?” she asked, with a coquettish melancholy
in her voice.</p>

<p>Then Pestel told her about the stars. She listened with
radiant eyes, although it didn’t in the least interest her to
know how many millions of miles distant from the earth either
Sirius or Aldebaran happened to be, and what precisely was
the mystery which puzzled scientists in regard to the southern
heavens.</p>

<p>“Ah,” she breathed, and there was indulgence and a dreamy
scepticism in that sound.</p>

<p>The lieutenant, abandoning the cosmos and its infinities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
talked about himself and his life, of Letitia and of the impression
she had made on him, and of the fact that he thought
only of her by day and by night.</p>

<p>Letitia remained very, very still in order not to turn his
thoughts in another direction and thus disturb the sweet suspense
of her mood.</p>

<p>As befitted a man with a highly developed conscience, Pestel
had definitely laid his plans for the future. When he returned
at the end of six months, ways and means were to be
found for Letitia’s divorce from Stephen and her remarriage to
him. He thought of flight only as an extreme measure.</p>

<p>He told her that he was poor. Only a very small capital was
deposited in his name in Stuttgart. He was a Suabian&mdash;simple-hearted,
sober, and accurate.</p>

<p>“Ah,” Letitia sighed again, half-astonished and half-saddened.
“It doesn’t matter,” she said with determination. “I’m
rich. I own a great tract of forest land. My aunt, the
Countess Brainitz, gave it to me as a wedding present.”</p>

<p>“A forest? Where?” Pestel asked, and smiled.</p>

<p>“In Germany. Near Heiligenkreuz in the Rhön region.
It’s as big as a city, and when it’s sold it will bring a lot of
money. I’ve never been there, but I’ve been told that it contains
large deposits of some ore. That would have to be found
and exploited. Then I’d be even richer than if I sold the
forest.” These facts had grown in Letitia’s imagination; they
were the children of the dreams and wishes she had harboured
since her slavery in this strange land. She was not lying; she
had quite forgotten that she had invented it all. She wished
this thing to be so, and it had taken on reality in her mind.</p>

<p>“It’s too good, altogether too good to be true,” Pestel commented
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>His words moved Letitia. She began to sob and threw herself
on his breast. Her young life seemed hard to her and ugly
and surrounded by dangers. Nothing she had hoped for had
become reality. All her pretty soap-bubbles had burst in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
wind. Her tears sprang from her deep realization of this fact
and out of her fear of men and of her fate. She yearned for
a pair of strong arms to give her protection and security.</p>

<p>Pestel was also moved. He put his arms about her and ventured
to kiss her forehead. She sobbed more pitifully, and so
he kissed her mouth. Then she smiled. He said that he
would love her until he died, that no woman had ever inspired
such feelings in him.</p>

<p>She confessed to him that she was with child by the unloved
husband to whom she was chained. Pestel pressed her to his
bosom, and said: “The child is blood of your blood, and I
shall regard it as my own.”</p>

<p>The time was speeding dangerously. Holding each other’s
hands they went down the stairs. They parted with the
promise to write each other daily.</p>

<p>“When he returns from Africa I’ll flee with him on his
ship,” Letitia determined, as she rode home slowly across the
dark plain. Everything else seemed ugly and a bore to her.
“Oh, if only it were to be soon,” she thought in her anxiety
and heart-ache. And curiosity stirred in her to know how
Pestel would behave and master the dangers and the difficulties
involved. She believed in him, and gave herself up to tender
and tempting dreams of the future.</p>

<p>In the house her absence had finally been noticed, and
servants had been sent out to look for her. She slipped into
the house by obscure paths, and then emerged from her room
with an air of innocence.</p>


<h3>XVIII</h3>

<p>Stettner had returned to Hamburg. His ship was to sail on
that very evening. He had several errands in the city, and
Christian and Crammon waited for him in order to accompany
him to the pier.</p>

<p>Crammon said: “A captain of Hussars who suddenly turns
up in mufti&mdash;I can’t help it, there’s something desperate about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
it to me. I feel as though I were on a perpetual visit of condolence.
After all, he’s déclassé, and I don’t like people in that
situation. Social classes are a divine institution; a man who
interferes with them wounds his own character. One doesn’t
throw up one’s profession the way one tosses aside a rotten
apple. These are delicate and difficult matters. Common
sense may disregard them; the higher intelligence reverences
them. What is he going to do among the Yankees? What
good can come of it?”</p>

<p>“He’s a chemist by inclination, and scholarly in his line,”
Christian answered. “That will help.”</p>

<p>“What do the Yankees care about that? He’s more likely to
catch consumption and be trodden under. He’ll be stripped of
pride and dignity. It’s a country for thieves, waiters, and
renegades. Did he have to go as far as all this?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Christian answered, “I believe he did.”</p>

<p>An hour later they and Stettner arrived at the harbour.
Cargoes and luggage were still being stowed, and they strolled,
Stettner between Crammon and Christian, up and down a narrow
alley lined with cotton-bales, boxes, barrels, and baskets.
The arc lamps cast radiant light from the tall masts, and a
tumult of carts and cranes, motors and bells, criers and whistles
rolled through the fog. The asphalt was wet; there was no
sky to be seen.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget me wholly here in the old land,” said Stettner.
A silence followed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether we shall be as well off in the old
country in the future as we have been in the past,” said Crammon,
who occasionally had pessimistic attacks and forebodings.
“Hitherto we haven’t suffered. Our larders and cellars
have been well-stocked, nor have the higher needs been neglected.
But times are getting worse, and, unless I mistake,
clouds are gathering on the political horizon. So I can’t call it
a bad idea, my dear Stettner, to slip away quietly and amiably.
I only hope that you’ll find some secure position over there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
from which you may calmly watch the spectacle of our débâcle.
And when the waves rise very high, you might think
of us and have a mass said for us, that is for me, because
Christian has been expelled from the bosom of Holy
Church.”</p>

<p>Stettner smiled at this speech. But he became serious again
at once. “It seems to me too that, in a sense, we’re all trapped
here. Yet I have never felt myself so deeply and devotedly a
German as at this moment when I am probably leaving my
fatherland forever. But in that feeling there is a stab of pain.
It seems to me as though I should hurry from one to another
and sound a warning. But what to warn them of, or why warn
them at all&mdash;I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Crammon answered weightily. “My dear old Aglaia wrote
me the other day that she had dreamed of black cats all night
long. She is deep, she has a prophetic soul, and dreams like
that are of evil presage. I may enter a monastery. It is
actually within the realm of the possible. Don’t laugh, Christian;
don’t laugh, my dearest boy! You don’t know all my
possibilities.”</p>

<p>It had not occurred to Christian to laugh.</p>

<p>Stettner stopped and gave his hands to his friends. “Good-bye,
Crammon,” he said cordially. “I’m grateful that you
accompanied me. Good-bye, dear Christian, good-bye.” He
pressed Christian’s hand long and firmly. Then he tore himself
away, hastened toward the gang-plank, and was lost in the
crowd.</p>

<p>“A nice fellow,” Crammon murmured. “A very nice fellow.
What a pity!”</p>

<p>When the car met them Christian said: “I’d like to walk a
bit, either back to the hotel or somewhere else. Will you
come, Bernard?”</p>

<p>“If you want me, yes. Toddling along is my portion.”</p>

<p>Christian dismissed his car. He had a strange foreboding, as
though something fateful were lying in wait for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ariel’s days here are numbered,” said Crammon. “Duty
calls me away. I must look after my two old ladies. Then I
must join Franz Lothar in Styria. We’ll hunt heath-cocks.
After that I’ve agreed to meet young Sinsheim in St. Moritz.
What are your plans, my dear boy?”</p>

<p>“I leave for Berlin to-morrow or the day after.”</p>

<p>“And what in God’s name are you going to do there?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to work.”</p>

<p>Crammon stopped, and opened his mouth very wide.
“Work?” he gasped, quite beside himself. “What at? What
for, O misguided one?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take courses at the university, under the
faculty of medicine.”</p>

<p>Horrified, Crammon shook his head. “Work ...
courses ... medicine.... Merciful Providence, what
does this mean? Is there not enough sweat in the world, not
enough bungling and half-wisdom and ugly ambition and useless
turmoil? You’re not serious.”</p>

<p>“You exaggerate as usual, Bernard,” Christian answered,
with a smile. “Don’t always be a Jeremiah. What I’m going
to do is something quite simple and conventional. And I’m
only going to try. I may not even succeed; but I must try
it. So much is sure.”</p>

<p>Crammon raised his hand, lifted a warning index finger,
and said with great solemnity: “You are upon an evil path,
Christian, upon a path of destruction. For many, many days
I have had a presentiment of terrible things. The sleep of
my nights has been embittered; a sorrow gnaws at me and
my peace has flown. How am I to hunt in the mountains when
I know you to be among the Pharisees? How shall I cast my
line into clear streams when my inner eye sees you bending
over greasy volumes or handling diseased bodies? No wine
will glitter beautifully in my glass, no girl’s eyes seem friendly
any more, no pear yield me its delicate flavour!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, they will,” Christian said, laughing. “More than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
that: I hope you’ll come to see me from time to time, to convince
yourself that you needn’t cast me off entirely.”</p>

<p>Crammon sighed. “Indeed I shall come. I must come and
soon, else the spirit of evil will get entire control of you. Which
may God forbid!”</p>


<h3>XIX</h3>

<p>Johanna told Eva, whom she adored, about her life. Eva
thus received an unexpected insight into the grey depths of
middle-class existence. The account sounded repulsive. But
it was stimulating to offer a spiritual refuge to so much thirst
and flight.</p>

<p>She herself often seemed to her own soul like one in flight.
But she had her bulwarks. The wind of time seemed cold to
her, and when she felt a horror of the busy marionettes whose
strings were in her hands, she felt herself growing harder.
The friendship which she gave to this devoted girl seemed to
her a rest in the mad race of her fate.</p>

<p>They were so intimate that Susan Rappard complained.
The latter opened her eyes wide and her jealousy led her to
become a spy. She became aware of the relations that had
developed between Johanna and Christian.</p>

<p>At dinner there had been much merriment. Johanna had
bought a number of peaked, woollen caps. She had wrapped
them carefully in white paper, written some witty verses on
each bundle, and distributed them as favours to Eva’s guests.
No one had been vexed. For despite her mockery and gentle
eccentricity, there was a charm about her that disarmed every
one.</p>

<p>“How gay you are to-day, Rumpelstilzkin,” Eva said. She,
too, used that nickname. The word, which she pronounced
with some difficulty, had a peculiar charm upon her lips.</p>

<p>“It is the gaiety that precedes tears,” Johanna answered,
and yielded as entirely to her superstitious terror as she had
to her jesting mood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>A wealthy ship-owner had invited Eva to view his private
picture gallery. His house was in the suburbs. She drove
there with Johanna.</p>

<p>Arm in arm they stood before the paintings. And in that
absorbed union there was something purifying. Johanna loved
it as she loved their common reading of poetry, when they
would sit with their cheeks almost touching. Extinguished in
her selfless adoration, she forgot what lay behind her&mdash;the
anxious, sticky, unworthily ambitious life of her family of
brokers; she forgot what lay before her&mdash;oppression and force,
an inevitable and appointed way.</p>

<p>Her gestures revealed a gentle glow of tenderness.</p>

<p>On their way back she seemed pale. “You are cold,” Eva
said, and wrapped the robe more firmly about her friend.</p>

<p>Johanna squeezed Eva’s hand gratefully. “How dear of
you! I shall always need some one to tell me when I’m hot
or cold.”</p>

<p>This melancholy jest moved Eva deeply. “Why do you act
so humble?” she cried. “Why do you shrink and hide and
turn your vision away from yourself? Why do you not dare
to be happy?”</p>

<p>Johanna answered: “Do you not know that I am a Jewess?”</p>

<p>“Well?” Eva asked in her turn. “I know some very extraordinary
people who are Jews&mdash;some of the proudest, wisest,
most impassioned in the world.”</p>

<p>Johanna shook her head. “In the Middle Ages the Jews
were forced to wear yellow badges on their garments,” she
said. “I wear the yellow badge upon my soul.”</p>

<p>Eva was putting on a tea gown. Susan Rappard was helping
her. “What’s new with us, Susan?” Eva asked, and took
the clasps out of her hair.</p>

<p>Susan answered: “What is good is not new, and what is
new is not good. Your ugly little court fool is having an
affair with M. Wahnschaffe. They are very secretive, but there
are whispers. I don’t understand him. He is easily and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
quickly consoled. I have always said that he has neither
a mind nor a heart. Now it is plain that he has no eyes
either.”</p>

<p>Eva had flushed very dark. Now she became very pale.
“It is a lie,” she said.</p>

<p>Susan’s voice was quite dry. “It is the truth. Ask her. I
don’t think she’ll deny it.”</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter Johanna slipped into the room. She had
on a dress of simple, black velvet which set off her figure
charmingly. Eva sat before the mirror. Susan was arranging
her hair. She had a book in her hand and read without looking
up.</p>

<p>On a chair near the dressing-table lay an open jewel case.
Johanna stood before it, smiled timidly, and took out of it a
beautifully cut cameo, which she playfully fastened to her
bosom; she looked admiringly at a diadem and put it in her
hair; she slipped on a few rings and a pearl bracelet over her
sleeve. Thus adorned she went, half hesitatingly, half with an
air of self-mockery, up to Eva.</p>

<p>Slowly Eva lifted her eyes from the book, looked at Johanna,
and asked: “Is it true?” She let a few seconds pass, and
then with wider open eyes she asked once more: “Is it
true?”</p>

<p>Johanna drew back, and the colour left her cheeks. She
suspected and knew and began to tremble.</p>

<p>Then Eva arose and went close up to her and stripped the
cameo from the girl’s bosom, the diadem from her hair, the
rings from her fingers, the bracelet from her arm, and threw
the things back into the case. Then she sat down again, took
up her book, and said: “Hurry, Susan! I want to rest a
little.”</p>

<p>Johanna’s breath failed her. She looked like one who has
been struck. A tender blossom in her heart was crushed forever,
and from its sudden withering arose a subtle miasma.
Almost on the point of fainting she left the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>As though to seal the end of a period in her life and warn
her of evil things to come, she received within two hours a telegram
from her mother which informed her of a catastrophe
and urgently summoned her home. Fräulein Grabmeier began
packing at once. They were to catch the train at five o’clock
in the morning.</p>

<p>From midnight on Johanna sat waiting in Christian’s room.
She lit no light. In the darkness she sat beside a table, resting
her head in her hands. She did not move, and her eyes were
fixed on vacancy.</p>


<h3>XX</h3>

<p>In the course of their talk Christian and Crammon had
wandered farther and farther into the tangled alleys around the
harbour. “Let us turn back and seek a way out,” Crammon
suggested. “It isn’t very nice here. A damnable neighbourhood,
in fact.”</p>

<p>He peered about, and Christian too looked around. When
they had gone a few steps farther, they came upon a man lying
flat on his belly on the pavement. He struggled convulsively,
croaked obscene curses, and shook his fist threateningly toward
a red-curtained, brightly lit door.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, and a second man flew out. A
paper box, an umbrella, and a derby hat were pitched out after
him. He stumbled down the steps with outstretched arms,
fell beside the first man, and remained sitting there with heavy
eyes.</p>

<p>Christian and Crammon looked in through the open door.
In the smoky light twenty or thirty people were crouching.
The monotonous crying of a woman became audible. At times
it became shriller.</p>

<p>The glass door was flung shut.</p>

<p>“I shall see what goes on in there,” said Christian, and
mounted the steps to the door. Crammon had only time to
utter a horrified warning. But he followed. The reek of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
cheap whiskey struck him as he entered the room behind
Christian.</p>

<p>Beside tables and on the floor crouched men and women.
In every corner lay people, sleeping or drunk. The eyes which
were turned toward the newcomers were glassy. The faces
here looked like lumps of earth. The room, with its dirty
tables, glasses, and bottles had a colour-scheme of scarlet and
yellow. Two sturdy fellows stood behind the bar.</p>

<p>The woman whose crying had penetrated to the street sat
on a bench beside the wall. Blood was streaming down her
face, and she continued to utter her monotonous and almost
bestial whine. In front of her, trying hard to keep erect on
legs stretched far apart, stood the huge fellow whom Christian
had observed at the public funeral of the murdered harlot.
In a hoarse voice, in the extreme jargon of the Berlin populace,
he was shouting: “Yuh gonna git what’s comin’ to yuh! I’ll
show yuh what’s what! I’ll blow off yer dam’ head-piece’n
yuh cin go fetch it in the moon!”</p>

<p>On the threshold of an open door in the rear stood a stout
man with innumerable watch-charms dangling across his
checked waistcoat. A fat cigar was held between his yellow
teeth. He regarded the scene with a superior calm. It was the
proprietor of the place. When he saw the two strangers his
brows went up. He first took them to be detectives, and hastened
to meet them. Then he saw his mistake and was the
more amazed. “Come into my office, gentlemen,” he said in
a greasy voice, and without removing the cigar. “Come back
there, and I’ll give you a drink of something good.” He drew
Christian along by the arm. A woman with a yellow head-kerchief
arose from the floor, stretched out her arms toward
Christian, and begged for ten pfennigs. Christian drew back
as from a worm.</p>

<p>An old man tried to prevent the gigantic lout from maltreating
the bleeding woman any more. He called him Mesecke and
fawned upon him. But Mesecke gave him a blow under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
chin that sent him spinning and moaning. Murmurs of protest
sounded, but no one dared to offend the giant. The proprietor
whispered to Christian: “What he wants is brass;
wants her to go on the street again and earn a little. Nothing
to be done right now.”</p>

<p>He grasped Crammon by the sleeve too, and drew them both
through the door into a dark hall. “I suppose you gentlemen
are interested in my establishment?” he asked anxiously. He
opened a door and forced them to enter. The room into which
they came showed a tasteless attempt at such luxury as is
represented by red plush and gilt frames. The place was
small, and the furniture stood huddled together. Crossed
swords hung above a bunch of peacock feathers, and above the
swords the gay cap of a student fraternity. Between two windows
stood a slanting desk covered with ledgers. An emaciated
man with a yellowish face sat at the desk and made entries in
a book. He quivered when the proprietor entered the room,
and bent more zealously over his work.</p>

<p>The proprietor said: “I’ve got to take care of you gents
or something might happen. When that son of a gun is quiet
you can go back and look the place over. I guess you’re
strangers here, eh?” From a shelf he took down a bottle.
“Brandy,” he whispered. “Prime stuff. You must try it.
I sell it by the bottle and by the case. A number one! Here
you are!” Crammon regarded Christian, whose face was without
any sign of disquiet. With a sombre expression he went
to the table and, as though unseeing, touched his lips to the
glass which the proprietor had filled. It was a momentary
refuge, at all events.</p>

<p>In the meantime a frightful noise penetrated from the outer
room. “Fighting again,” said the proprietor, listened for a
moment, and then disappeared. The noise increased furiously
for a moment. Then silence fell. The book-keeper, without
raising his waxy face, said: “Nobody can stand that. It’s
that way every night. And the books here show the profits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
That man Hillebohm is a millionaire, and he rakes in more
and more money without mercy, without compassion. Nobody
can stand that.”</p>

<p>The words sounded like those of a madman.</p>

<p>“Are we going to permit ourselves to be locked up here?”
Crammon asked indignantly. “It’s rank impudence.”</p>

<p>Christian opened the door, and Crammon drew from his
back pocket the Browning revolver that was his constant companion.
They passed through the hall and stopped on the
threshold of the outer room. Mesecke had vanished. Many
arms had finally expelled him. The woman from whom he had
been trying to get money was washing the blood from her
face. The old man who had been beaten when he had pleaded
for her said consolingly: “Don’t yuh howl, Karen. Things’ll
get better. Keep up, says I!” The woman hardly listened.
She looked treacherous and angry.</p>

<p>A tangle of yellow hair flamed on her head, high as a helmet
and unkempt. While she was bleeding she had wiped the
blood with her naked hand, and then stained her hair with it.</p>

<p>“You go home now,” the proprietor commanded. “Wash
your paws and give our regards to God if you see him. Hurry
up, or your sweetheart’ll be back and give you a little
more.”</p>

<p>She did not move. “Well, how about it, Karen,” a woman
shrilled. “Hurry. D’yuh want some more beating?”</p>

<p>But the woman did not stir. She breathed heavily, and
suddenly looked at Christian.</p>

<p>“Come with us,” Christian said unexpectedly. The bar-tenders
roared with laughter. Crammon laid a hand of desperate
warning on Christian’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come with us,” Christian repeated calmly. “We will take
you home.”</p>

<p>A dozen glassy eyes stared their mockery. A voice brayed:
“Hell, hell, but you’re gettin’ somethin’ elegant.” Another
hummed as though scanning verses: “If that don’t kill the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
bedbugs dead, I dunno what’ll do instead! Don’t yuh be
scared, Karen. Hurry! Use your legs!”</p>

<p>Karen got up. She had not taken her shy and sombre eyes
from Christian. His beauty overwhelmed her. A crooked,
frightened, cynical smile glided over her full lips.</p>

<p>She was rather tall. She had fine shoulders and a well-developed
bosom. She was with child&mdash;perhaps five months;
it was obvious when she stood. She wore a dark green dress
with iridescent buttons, and at her neck a flaming red riband
fastened by a brooch that represented in silver, set with garnets,
a Venetian gondola, and bore the inscription: <i>Ricordo di Venezia</i>.
Her shoes were clumsy and muddy. Her hat&mdash;made of
imitation kid and trimmed with cherries of rubber&mdash;lay beside
her on the bench. She grasped it with a strange ferocity.</p>

<p>Christian looked at the riband and at the silver brooch with
its inscription: <i>Ricordo di Venezia</i>.</p>

<p>Crammon sought to protect their backs. For new guests
were coming in&mdash;fellows with dangerous faces. He had simply
yielded to the inevitable and incomprehensible, and determined
to give a good account of himself. He gritted his teeth over the
absence of proper police protection, and said to himself: “We
won’t get out of this hole alive, old boy.” And he thought of
his comfortable hotel-bed, his delicious, fragrant bath, his excellent
breakfast, and of the box of chocolates on his table.
He thought of young girls who exhaled the fresh sweetness of
linen, of all pleasant fragrances, of Ariel’s smile and Rumpelstilzkin’s
gaiety, and of the express train that was to have
taken him to Vienna. He thought of all these things as though
his last hour had come.</p>

<p>Two sailors came in dragging between them a girl who was
pale and stiff with drunkenness. Roughly they threw her on
the floor. The creature moaned, and had an expression of
ghastly voluptuousness, of strange lasciviousness on her face.
She lay there stiff as a board. The sailors, with a challenge in
their voices, asked after Mesecke. He had evidently met them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and complained to them. They wanted to get even with the
proprietor. One of them had a scarlet scratch across his forehead;
the other’s arms were naked up to his shoulders and
tattooed until they were blue all over. The tattooing represented
a snake, a winged wheel, an anchor, a skull, a phallus, a
scale, a fish, and many other objects.</p>

<p>Both sailors measured Christian and Crammon with impudent
glances. The one with the tattooed arms pointed to the
revolver in Crammon’s hand, and said: “If you don’t put up
that there pistol I’ll make you, by God!”</p>

<p>The other went up to Christian and stood so close to him
that he turned pale. Vulgarity had never yet touched him,
nor had the obscene things of the gutter splashed his garments.
Contempt and disgust arose hotly in him. These might force
him to abandon his new road; for they were more terrible than
the vision of evil he had had in the house of Szilaghin.</p>

<p>But when he looked into the man’s eyes, he became aware
of the fact that the latter could not endure his glance. Those
eyes twitched and flickered and fled. And this perception gave
Christian courage and a feeling of inner power, the full effectiveness
of which was still uncertain.</p>

<p>“Quiet there!” the proprietor roared at the two sailors.
“I want order. You want to get the police here, do you?
That’d be fine for us all, eh? You’re a bit crazy, eh? The
girl can go with the gentlemen, if they’ll pay her score. Two
glasses champagne&mdash;that’s one mark fifty. And that ends it.”</p>

<p>Crammon laid a two-mark piece on the table. Karen Engelschall
had put on her hat, and turned toward the door. Christian
and Crammon followed her, and the proprietor followed
them with sarcastic courtesy, while the two sturdy bar-tenders
formed an additional bodyguard. A few half-drunken men
sent the strains of a jeering song behind them.</p>

<p>The street was empty. Karen gazed up and down it, and
seemed uncertain in which direction she should go. Crammon
asked her where she lived. She answered harshly that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
didn’t want to go home. “Then where shall we take you?”
Crammon asked, forcing himself to be patient and considerate.
She shrugged her shoulders. “It don’t matter,” she said.
Then, after a while, she added defiantly. “I don’t need you.”</p>

<p>They went toward the harbour, Karen between the two men.
For a moment she stopped and murmured with a shudder of
fear: “But I mustn’t run into him. No, I mustn’t.”</p>

<p>“Will you suggest something then?” Crammon said to her.
His impulse was simply to decamp, but for Christian’s sake,
and in the hope of saving him uninjured from this mesh of
adventures, he played the part of interest and compassion.</p>

<p>Karen Engelschall did not answer, but hurried more swiftly
as she caught sight of a figure in the light of a street lamp.
Until she was beyond its vision she gasped with terror.</p>

<p>“Shall we give you money?” Crammon asked again.</p>

<p>She answered furiously: “I don’t need your money. I want
no money.” Surreptitiously she gazed at Christian, and her
face grew malicious and stubborn.</p>

<p>Crammon went over beside Christian, and spoke to him in
French. “The best thing would be to take her to an inn where
she can get a room and a bed. We can deposit a sum of money
there, so that she is sheltered for a while. Then she can help
herself.”</p>

<p>“Quite right. That will be best,” Christian replied. And, as
though he could not bear to address her, he added: “Tell her
that.”</p>

<p>Karen stopped. She lifted her shoulders as though she were
cold, and said in a hoarse voice: “Leave me alone. What are
you two talking about? I won’t walk another step. I’m tired.
Don’t pay no attention to me!” She leaned against the wall
of a house, and her hat was pushed forward over her forehead.
She was as sorry and dissipated a looking object as one could
possibly imagine.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that the sign of an inn?” Crammon asked and pointed
to an illuminated sign at the far end of the street.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Christian, who had very keen eyes, looked and answered:
“Yes. It says ‘King of Greece.’ Do go and inquire.”</p>

<p>“A lovely neighbourhood and a lovely errand,” Crammon
said plaintively. “I am paying for my sins.” But he
went.</p>

<p>Christian remained with the woman, who looked down
silently and angrily. Her fingers scratched at her riband.
Christian listened to the beating of the tower-clock. It struck
two. At last Crammon reappeared. He beckoned from a distance
and cried: “Ready.”</p>

<p>Christian addressed the girl for the first time. “We’ve found
a shelter for you,” he said, a little throatily, and, quite contrary
to his wont, blinked his eyes. His own voice sounded disagreeably
in his ears. “You can stay there for some days.”</p>

<p>She looked at him with eyes that glowed with hatred. An
indescribable but evil curiosity burned in her glance. Then
she lowered her eyes again. Christian was forced to speak
again: “I think you will be safe from that man there. Try
to rest. Perhaps you are ill. We could summon a physician.”</p>

<p>She laughed a soft, sarcastic laugh. Her breath smelt of
whiskey.</p>

<p>Crammon called out again.</p>

<p>“Come on then,” Christian said, mastering his aversion with
difficulty.</p>

<p>His voice and his words made the same overwhelming impression
on her that his appearance had done. She started to
go as though she were being propelled from behind.</p>

<p>A sleepy porter in slippers stood at the door of the inn. His
servile courtesy proved that Crammon had known how to treat
him. “Number 14 on the second floor is vacant,” he said.</p>

<p>“Send some one to your lodgings to-morrow for your things,”
Crammon advised the girl.</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him. Without a word of thanks
or greeting she followed the porter up the soiled red carpet of
the stairs. The rubber cherries tapped audibly against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
brim of her hat. Her clumsy form disappeared in the blackness.</p>

<p>Crammon breathed a sigh of relief. “My kingdom for a
four-wheeler,” he moaned. At a nearby corner they found a
cab.</p>


<h3>XXI</h3>

<p>When Christian entered his room and switched on the electric
light, he was surprised to find Johanna sitting at the table.
She shaded her eyes from the sudden glare. He remained at
the door. His frown disappeared when he saw the deadly
pallor of the girl’s face.</p>

<p>“I must leave,” Johanna breathed. “I’ve received a telegram
and I must start for Vienna at once.”</p>

<p>“I am about to leave, too,” Christian answered.</p>

<p>For a while there was silence. Then Johanna said: “Shall I
see you again? Will you want me to? Dare I?” Her timid
questions showed the old division of her soul. She smiled a
smile of patience and renunciation.</p>

<p>“I shall be in Berlin,” Christian answered. “I don’t know
yet where I shall live. But whenever you want to know, ask
Crammon. He is easily reached. His two old ladies send him
all letters.”</p>

<p>“If you desire it, I can come to Berlin,” Johanna said with
the same patient and resigned smile. “I have relatives there.
But I don’t think that you do desire it.” Then, after a pause,
during which her gentle eyes wandered aimlessly, she said:
“Then is this to be the end?” She held her breath; she was
taut as a bow-string.</p>

<p>Christian went up to the table and rested the index finger
of one hand on its top. With lowered head he said slowly:
“Don’t demand a decision of me. I cannot make one. I
should hate to hurt you. I don’t want something to happen
again that has happened so often before in my life. If you
feel impelled to come&mdash;come! Don’t consider me. Don’t think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
above all, that I would then leave you in the lurch. But just
now is a critical time in my life. More I cannot say.”</p>

<p>Johanna could gather nothing but what was hopeless for herself
from these words. Yet through them there sounded a note
that softened their merely selfish regretfulness. With a characteristically
pliant gesture, she stretched out her arm to
Christian. Her pose was formal and her smile faint, as she
said: “Then, au revoir&mdash;perhaps!”</p>


<h3>XXII</h3>

<p>When the girl had gone, Christian lay down on the sofa and
folded his hands beneath his head. Thus he lay until dawn.
He neither switched off the light nor did he close his eyes.</p>

<p>He saw the paintless stairs that led to the den where he had
been and the red carpet of the inn soiled by many feet; he saw
the lamp in the desolate street and the watch charms on the
proprietor’s waistcoat; he saw the brandy bottle on the shelf,
and the green shawl of one of the drunken women, and the
tattooed symbols on the sailor’s naked arm: the anchor, the
winged wheel, the phallus, the fish, the snake; he saw the rubber
cherries on the prostitute’s hat and the silver brooch with
the garnets and the foolish motto: <i>Ricordo di Venezia</i>.</p>

<p>And more and more as he thought of these things they
awakened in him an ever surer feeling of freedom and of
liberation, and seemed to release him from other things that
he had hitherto loved, the rare and precious things that he had
loved so exclusively and fruitlessly. And they seemed to release
him likewise from men and women whose friendship or
love had been sterile in the end.</p>

<p>As he lay there and gazed into space, he lived in these poor
and mean things, and all fruitless occupations and human relationships
lost their importance; and even the thought of Eva
ceased to torment him and betray him into fruitless humiliation.</p>

<p>That radiant and regal creature allured him no more, when
he thought of the blood-stained face of the harlot. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
latter aroused in him a feeling akin to curiosity that gradually
filled his soul so entirely that it left room for nothing else.</p>

<p>Toward dawn he slumbered for an hour. Then he arose,
and bathed his face in cold water, left the hotel, hired a cab,
and drove to the inn called “The King of Greece.”</p>

<p>The nightwatchman was still at his post. He recognized this
early guest and guided him with disagreeable eagerness up
two flights of stairs to the room of Karen Engelschall.</p>

<p>Christian knocked. There was no answer. “You just go
in, sir,” said the porter. “There ain’t no key and the latch
don’t work. All kinds of things will happen, and it’s better for
us to have the doors unlocked.”</p>

<p>Christian entered. It was a room with ugly brown furnishings,
a dark-red plush sofa, a round mirror with a crack across
its middle, an electric bulb at the end of a naked wire, and a
chromo-lithograph of the emperor. Everything was dusty,
worn, shabby, used-up, poor and mean.</p>

<p>Karen Engelschall lay in the bed asleep. She was on her
back, and her dishevelled hair looked like a bundle of straw;
her face was pale and a little puffy. Recent scars showed on
her forehead and right cheek. Her full but flaccid breasts
protruded above the coverings.</p>

<p>His old and violent dislike of sleeping people stirred in
Christian, but he mastered it and regarded her face. He wondered
from what social class she had come, whether she was a
sailor’s or a fisherman’s daughter, a girl of the lower middle-classes,
of the proletariat or the peasantry. Thus his curiosity
employed his mind for a while until he became fully aware of
the indescribable perturbation of that face. It was as void of
evil as of good; but as it lay there it seemed distraught by the
unheard of torment of its dreams. Then Christian thought of
the carnelian on Mesecke’s hand, and the repulsively red stone
which was like a beetle or a piece of raw flesh became extraordinarily
vivid to him.</p>

<p>He made a movement and knocked against a chair; the noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
awakened Karen Engelschall. She opened her lids, and fear
and horror burned in her eyes when she observed a figure in
her room; her features became distorted with fury, and her
mouth rounded itself for a cry. Then she saw who the intruder
was, and with a sigh of relief slid back among the pillows. Her
face reassumed its expression of stubbornness and of enforced
yielding. She watched, not knowing what to make of this
visit, and seemed to wonder and reflect. She drew the covers
up under her chin, and smiled a shallow, flattered smile.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Christian’s eyes looked for the red riband and
the silver brooch. The girl’s garments had been flung pell-mell
on a chair. The hat with the rubber cherries lay on the table.</p>

<p>“Why do you stand?” Karen Engelschall asked in a cheerful
voice. “Sit down.” Again, as in the night, his splendour
and distinction overwhelmed her. Smiling her empty smile, she
wondered whether he was a baron or a count. She had slept
soundly and felt refreshed.</p>

<p>“You cannot stay in this house very long,” Christian said
courteously. “I have considered what had better be done for
you. Your condition requires care. You must not expose
yourself to the brutality of that man. It would be best if you
left the city.”</p>

<p>Karen Engelschall laughed a harsh laugh. “Leave the city?
How’s that going to be done? Girls like me have to stay where
they are.”</p>

<p>“Has any one a special claim on you?” Christian asked.</p>

<p>“Claim? Why? How do you mean? Oh, I see. No, no.
It’s the way things are in our business. The feller to whom you
give your money, he protects you, and the others mind him.
If he’s strong and has many friends you’re safe. They’re all
rotten, but you got no choice. You get no rest day or night,
and your flesh gets tired, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine that,” Christian replied, and for a second
looked into Karen’s round and lightless eyes, “and for that
reason I wanted to put myself at your disposal. I shall leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
Hamburg either to-day or to-morrow, and probably stay in
Berlin for some months. I am ready to take you with me.
But you must not delay your decision, because I have not yet
any address in Berlin, I don’t know yet where I shall live, and
if a plan like this is delayed it is usually not carried out at all.
At the moment you have eluded your pursuer, and so the opportunity
to escape is good. You don’t need to send for your
things. I can get you whatever you need when we arrive.”</p>

<p>Those words, spoken with real friendliness, did not have the
effect which Christian expected. Karen Engelschall could not
realize the simplicity and frankness of their intention. A mocking
suspicion arose in her mind. She knew of Vice Crusaders
and Preachers of Salvation; and these men her world as a
rule fears as much as it does the emissaries of the police.
But she looked at Christian more sharply, and an instinct
told her that she was on the wrong track. Clumsily considering,
she drifted to other suppositions that had a tinge of cheap
romance. She thought of plots and kidnapping and a possible
fate more terrible than that under the heel of her old tormentor.
She brooded over these thoughts in haste and rage, with convulsed
features and clenched fist, passing from fear to hope
and from hope to distrust, and yet, even as on the day before,
compelled by something irresistible, a force from which she
could not withdraw and which made her struggles futile.</p>

<p>“What do you want to do with me?” she asked, and gave
him a penetrating glance.</p>

<p>Christian considered in order to weigh his answer carefully.
“Nothing but what I have told you.”</p>

<p>She became silent and stared at her hands. “My mother
lives in Berlin,” she murmured. “Maybe you’d want me to
go back to her. I don’t want to.”</p>

<p>“You are to go with me.” Christian’s tone was firm and
almost hard. His chest filled with breath and exhaled the
air painfully. The final word had been spoken.</p>

<p>Karen looked at him again. But now her eyes were serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
and awake to reality. “And what shall I do when I’m with
you?”</p>

<p>Christian answered hesitatingly: “I’ve come to no decision
about that. I must think it over.”</p>

<p>Karen folded her hands. “But I’ve got to know who you
are.”</p>

<p>He spoke his name.</p>

<p>“I am a pregnant woman,” she said with a sombre look, and
for the first time her voice trembled, “a street-walker who’s
pregnant. Do you know that? I’m the lowest and vilest
thing in the whole world! Do you know that?”</p>

<p>“I know it,” said Christian, and cast down his eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, what does a fine gentleman like you want to do with
me? Why do you take such an interest in me?”</p>

<p>“I can’t explain that to you at the moment,” Christian
answered diffidently.</p>

<p>“What am I to do? Go with you? Right away?”</p>

<p>“If you are willing, I shall call for you at two, and we can
drive to the station.”</p>

<p>“And you won’t be ashamed of me?”</p>

<p>“No, I shall not be ashamed.”</p>

<p>“You know how I look? Suppose people point their fingers
at the whore travelling with such an elegant gentleman?”</p>

<p>“It does not matter what people do.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll wait for you.” She crossed her arms over
her breast and stared at the ceiling and did not stir. Christian
arose and nodded and went out. Nor did Karen move when he
was gone. A deep furrow appeared on her forehead, the fresh
scars gleamed like burns upon her earthy skin, a dull and
primitive amazement turned her eyes to stone.</p>


<h3>XXIII</h3>

<p>When Christian crossed the reception room of the hotel he
saw Crammon sitting sadly in a chair. Christian stopped and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
smiled and held out his hand. “Did you sleep well, Bernard?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“If that were my only difficulty I should not complain,”
Crammon answered. “I always sleep well. The troubles begin
when I’m awake. Age with his stealing steps! The old pleasures
no longer sting, the old delights are worn out. One counts
on gratitude and affection, and gets care and disappointment.
I think a monastery would be the best place for me. I must
look into that plan more closely.”</p>

<p>Christian laughed. “Come now, Bernard, you would be a
very unsuitable person in a monastery. Drive the black
thoughts away and let us have breakfast.”</p>

<p>“All right, let us have breakfast.” Crammon arose. “Have
you any idea why poor Rumpelstilzkin suddenly fled by night?
She had bad news from home, I am told, but that’s no reason
why she should have gone without a word. It was not nice or
considerate. And in a few hours Ariel too will be lost to us.
Her rooms are filled with cases and boxes, and M. Chinard is
bursting with self-importance. Black clouds are over us, and
all our lovely rainbows fade. This caviare, by the way, is
excellent. I shall withdraw into an utterly private life. Perhaps
I shall hire a secretary, either a man or a fat, appetizing,
and discreet woman, and begin to dictate my memoirs. You,
my dear fellow, seem in more excellent spirits than for a long
time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, excellent,” Christian said, and his smile revealed his
beautiful teeth. “Excellent!” he repeated, and held out his
hand to his astonished friend.</p>

<p>“So you have finally become reconciled to your loss?”
he winked, and pointed upward with a significant gesture.</p>

<p>Christian guessed his meaning. “Entirely,” he said cheerily.
“I’m completely recovered.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” said Crammon, and, comfortably eating, he philosophized:
“It would be saddening were it otherwise. I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>peat
what I have often said: Ariel was born for the stars.
There are blessed stars and fateful stars. Some are inhabited
by good spirits, others by demons. We have known that
from times immemorial. Let them wage their battles among
themselves. If it comes to collisions and catastrophes, it is a
cosmic matter in which we mortals have no share. When all
is said and done, you are but a mortal too, though one so
blessed that you were even granted a stay in the happy hunting
grounds of the gods. But excesses are evil. You cannot
compete with Muscovite autocrats. Siegfried can conquer the
dragons in the end; were Lucifer to attack him with fire-breathing
steeds, the hero would but risk his skin in vain.
Your renunciation is as wise as it is delightful. I drink to
your pleasant future, dearest boy!”</p>

<p>Christian went to a buffet where magnificent fruit was exposed
for sale. He knew Crammon’s passionate delight in rare
and lovely fruit. He selected a woven basket and placed in the
middle a pine-apple cut open so that its golden inside showed.
He surrounded it with a wreath of flawless apples and of great,
amber-coloured peaches from the South of France. They were
elastic and yet firm. He added seven enormous clusters of
California grapes. He arranged the fruit artistically, carried
the basket to Crammon, and presented it to him with jesting
solemnity.</p>

<p>They separated. When, late that afternoon, Crammon returned
to the hotel, he learned to his bitter amazement that
Christian had left.</p>

<p>He could not compose himself. It seemed to him that he
was the victim of some secret cabal. “They all leave me in the
lurch,” he murmured angrily to himself; “they make a mock of
me. It’s like an epidemic. You are through with life, Bernard
Gervasius, you are in every one’s way. Go to your cell and
bemoan your fate.”</p>

<p>He ordered his valet to pack, and to secure accommodations
on the train to Vienna. Then he placed the basket of fruit on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the table, and in his sad reflections plucked berry after berry of
the grape.</p>


<h3>XXIV</h3>

<p>In his quiet little house, furnished in the style of the age of
Maria Theresa, he forgot what he had suffered. He lived an
idyl.</p>

<p>He accompanied the two pious ladies to church, and out of
considerateness and kindness to them even prayed occasionally.
His chief prayer was: Lord, forgive those who have trespassed
against me and lead me not into temptation. On sunny afternoons
the carriage appeared and took the three for a ride
through the parks. In the evening the bill of fare for the
following day was determined on, and the national and traditional
dishes were given the preference. Then he read to the
devoutly attentive Misses Aglaia and Constantine classical
poems: a canto of Klopstock’s “Messiah,” Schiller’s “Walk,”
or something by Rückert. And he still imitated the voice and
intonation of Edgar Lorm. Also he related harmless anecdotes
connected with his life; and he adorned and purified them so
that they would have been worthy of a schoolgirl’s library.</p>

<p>Not till the two ladies had retired did he light his short
pipe or pour himself out a glass of cognac; he practised reminiscence
or introspection, or became absorbed in his little
museum of treasures, which he had gathered during many
years.</p>

<p>Shortly before his proposed meeting with Franz Lothar von
Westernach, he received an alarming letter from Christian’s
mother.</p>

<p>Frau Wahnschaffe informed him that Christian had ordered
all his possessions to be sold&mdash;Christian’s Rest, Waldleiningen,
the hunting lodge, the stables and kennels, the motor cars, the
collections, including the wonderful collection of rings. This
incomprehensible plan was actually being carried out, and no
one had an inkling of the motive. She herself was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
utmost despair, and begged Crammon for some explanation
and, if possible, to come to the castle. She besought him in
God’s name for some hint in regard to Christian’s actions and
state of mind. No news of her son had reached her for weeks;
he seemed lost, and they were groping in the dark. The family
did not, of course, desire his possessions to pass into the hands
of strangers, and would bid in everything, although it was
both difficult and hateful to oppose the impudent offers and
the tricky manœuvres which the auction ordered by Christian
would entail. Above all, however, there was her personal
anxiety about Christian. She expected Crammon to stand by
her in her hour of need, and justify the high opinion she had
formed both of his friendship for her son and of his attachment
to her family.</p>

<p>Crammon re-read the lines that mentioned the sale of
Christian’s Rest and of the collections. He shook his head
long and sadly, pressed his chin into his hands, and two large
tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
